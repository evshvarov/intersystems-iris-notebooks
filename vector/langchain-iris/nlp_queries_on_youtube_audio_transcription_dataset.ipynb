    "# NLP Queries on YouTube Audio Transcription Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to use `langchain-iris` for performing Natural Language Processing (NLP) queries on a YouTube audio transcription dataset. The notebook covers data loading, preprocessing, connecting to the vector database, and executing queries to find similarities. The results include scores, document content, and associated metadata, along with the option to display top-matching YouTube videos based on the queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was inspired in [this one](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb/blob/main/docs/src/notebooks/youtube_transcript_search.ipynb) and adapted to use `langchain-iris`.\r\n",

       "at the structure of our data.\n",
       "So when we're training a model for mass language modeling,\n",
       "we need a few tensors.\n",
       "We need three tensors.\n",
       "And this is for training Roberta, by the way, as well.\n",
       "Same thing with Bert as well.\n",
       "We have our input IDs, attention mask, and our labels.\n",
       "Our input IDs have roughly 15% of their values masked.\n",
       "So we can see that here we have these two tensors.\n",
       "These are the labels.\n",
       "And we have the real tokens in here, the token IDs.\n",
       "And then in our input IDs tensor,\n",
       "we have these being replaced with mask tokens,\n",
       "the number fours.\n",
       "So that's the structure of our input data.\n",
       "We've created a Torch data set from it\n",
       "and use that to create a Torch data loader.\n",
       "And with that, we can actually begin\n",
       "setting up our model for training.\n",
       "So there are a few things to that.\n",
       "We can't just begin training straight away.\n",
       "So the first thing that we need to do\n",
       "is create a Roberta config object.\n",
       "And the config object is something\n",
       "that we use when we're initializing a transformer\n",
       "from scratch in order to initialize it\n",
       "with a certain set of parameters.\n",
       "So we'll do that first.\n",
       "So we want from transformers import Roberta config.\n",
       "And to create that config object, we do this.\n",
       "So we do Roberta config.\n",
       "And then in here, we need to specify different parameters.\n",
       "Now, one of the main ones is the voc up size.\n",
       "Now, this needs to match to whichever voc up size\n",
       "we have already created in our tokenizer\n",
       "when we're initializing it.\n",
       "In our tokenizer, when building our tokenizer.\n",
       "So I mean, for me, if I go all the way up here to here,\n",
       "this is where I created the tokenizer.\n",
       "I can see, OK, it's this number here.\n",
       "So 30,522.\n",
       "So I'm going to set that.\n",
       "But if you don't have that, you can just write tokenizer voc\n",
       "up size.\n",
       "So here.\n",
       "And that will return your voc up size.\n",
       "So I mean, let's replace that.\n",
       "We'll do this.\n",
       "Now, as well as that, we want to also set this.\n",
       "So max position embedding.\n",
       "And this needs to be set to your max length plus two\n",
       "in this case.\n",
       "So max length is set up here.\n",
       "So where is it?\n",
       "Max length here, 512.\n",
       "Plus two because we have these added special tokens.\n",
       "If we don't do that, we'll end up with a index error\n",
       "because we're going beyond the embedding limits.\n",
       "Now we want our hidden size.\n",
       "So this is the size of the vectors\n",
       "that our embedding layers within Roberta will create.\n",
       "So each token, so we have 514 or 12 tokens.\n",
       "And each one of those will be signed a vector of size 768.\n",
       "This is the typical number.\n",
       "So that's the originally came from the BERT based model.\n",
       "Then we set up the architecture of the internals of the model.\n",
       "So we want the number of attention heads,\n",
       "which I'm going to set to 12.\n",
       "And also the number of hidden layers, which I...\n",
       "So the default for this is for Roberta, 12.\n",
       "But I'm going to go with six for the sake of keeping train\n",
       "times a little shorter.\n",
       "Now we also need to add type, vocab, size, which is just one.\n",
       "So that's the different token types that we have.\n",
       "We just have one.\n",
       "Don't need to worry about that.\n",
       "OK, so that's our configuration object ready.\n",
       "And we can import and initialize a Roberta model with that.\n",
       "So we went from transformers.\n",
       "This is kind of similar to what we usually do.\n",
       "Import Roberta.\n",
       "And we're doing this for massed LL.\n",
       "So MLM, right?\n",
       "So we're training using MLM.\n",
       "So we want Roberta for massed LL.\n",
       "And we initialize our model using that Roberta for massed LL\n",
       "object.\n",
       "And we just pass in our config.\n",
       "And this will...\n",
       "That's right there, initialize our Roberta model.\n",
       "So that's a plain Roberta model, randomly initialized weights,\n",
       "and so on.\n",
       "And now we can move on to setting up everything\n",
       "for training.\n",
       "So we have our model.\n",
       "Now we need to prepare a few things before we train it.\n",
       "First thing is we need to decide which device we're\n",
       "going to be training on.\n",
       "So whether that's CPU or a CUDA-enabled GPU.\n",
       "And to figure out if we have that, we write...\n",
       "Well, we can write torch CUDA is available.\n",
       "So write this.\n",
       "And for me, it is.\n",
       "So the typical way that you would decide whether you're\n",
       "using CUDA or CPU or the typical line of code that will decide it\n",
       "for you is you write device and you do torch.CUDA,\n",
       "or torch device, sorry.\n",
       "And then you write CUDA inside here.\n",
       "If it's available, otherwise we are going to use torch device CPU.\n",
       "Now, CPU takes...\n",
       "Yeah, it's just takes a really long time.\n",
       "So if you are using CPU, you have to leave it overnight,\n",
       "for sure.\n",
       "Maybe even longer.\n",
       "Even if it's just like a little bit of data, it takes so long.\n",
       "So but hopefully you have a GPU.\n",
       "If not, just you're going to have to be patient.\n",
       "That's all.\n",
       "Or if you could maybe try and use Google Colab,\n",
       "but you have to use a premium version because otherwise it's\n",
       "just going to shut off after like an hour or two.\n",
       "I don't know.\n",
       "I don't really use it.\n",
       "So I don't know how long it will train for before just deciding\n",
       "that it's done.\n",
       "And the GPU is also not that good anyway.\n",
       "So, yeah.\n",
       "However, you can do it.\n",
       "And then after that, we want to move our model to our device.\n",
       "So whether it's GPU or CPU, we move over there.\n",
       "We're going to get a really big output now.\n",
       "So it's just our model.\n",
       "So this is like the structure of our model.\n",
       "So we can see a few interesting things.\n",
       "We've got Roberta for MLM.\n",
       "We have the Roberta model.\n",
       "And then inside that we have our embeddings.\n",
       "And then we have our 12.\n",
       "Did I say 12?\n",
       "I think it was six.\n",
       "Six encoders should be.\n",
       "Yeah.\n",
       "So it goes from 0 to 5.\n",
       "It's our six.\n",
       "And then we have the outputs here.\n",
       "And then our final bit, which is the language modeling\n",
       "head, the MLM head.\n",
       "So that's cool.\n",
       "Now we need our optimizer.\n",
       "So from transformers, import AdamW,\n",
       "which is Adam with weight and decay.\n",
       "And what we're going to do is just\n",
       "going to activate the training mode of our model.\n",
       "It's going to give us loads of output again.\n",
       "So just, yeah.\n",
       "You know what?\n",
       "Maybe I can just, let's just remove that.\n",
       "There we go.\n",
       "Easier.\n",
       "And then our optimizer is going to be AdamW.\n",
       "We need to pass in our model parameters.\n",
       "And we need a learning rate.\n",
       "So from, I mean, I don't usually use Roberta.\n",
       "But looking online, this looks like a reasonable learning\n",
       "rate.\n",
       "I think you can go from sort of here to, I think,\n",
       "from what I remember down to like here.\n",
       "That's the sort of typical range.\n",
       "But obviously, it's going to depend on how much data\n",
       "you have.\n",
       "And we don't want to do that.\n",
       "How much data you have and loads of different things, right?\n",
       "So that's what I'm going to go with.\n",
       "And that should be pretty much it.\n",
       "So that's our setup.\n",
       "Now we're just going to create our training loop.\n",
       "Now for the training loop, we want to import TQDM.\n",
       "So we can see how far through we are.\n",
       "We're going to train for two epochs.\n",
       "And we're going to initialize our loop object using TQDM.\n",
       "So TQDM.\n",
       "We have our data loader.\n",
       "What is the name of that data loader?\n",
       "I'm not sure.\n",
       "Data loader.\n",
       "Cool.\n",
       "Data loader.\n",
       "And we set leave equals true.\n",
       "But I need that.\n",
       "Sorry.\n",
       "I need that in the same style.\n",
       "So for batch in loop.\n",
       "And then here, we run through each of the steps\n",
       "that we're going to perform for every single training loop.\n",
       "So the first thing we do is initialize the gradient\n",
       "in our optimizer.\n",
       "So zero grad.\n",
       "So the reason we do this is after the first loop,\n",
       "our optimizer is going to be assigned\n",
       "a set of gradients, which we're going\n",
       "to use to optimize our model.\n",
       "And on the next loop, we don't want those residual gradients\n",
       "to still be there in our optimizer.\n",
       "We want to essentially reset it for the next loop.\n",
       "So that's what we're doing here.\n",
       "Then we want our tensors.\n",
       "So we have input IDs.\n",
       "And that is going to be batch input IDs.\n",
       "And we also want to move that over to our GPU or CPU\n",
       "if you're on that.\n",
       "And this is pretty much the same for our three.\n",
       "So mask labels.\n",
       "And this is just attention mask.\n",
       "So we've extracted our tensors.\n",
       "And we just need to feed them into our model now.\n",
       "So we're going to get outputs from the model.\n",
       "We just do model.\n",
       "Input IDs, attention mask, which is going to be equal to mask.\n",
       "And our labels equal to labels.\n",
       "So everything has been fed into our model.\n",
       "We have our outputs.\n",
       "Now we need to extract a few things from the output.\n",
       "So we need the loss.\n",
       "So we write loss equals outputs.loss.\n",
       "And from that, we want to calculate\n",
       "all of the different parameters in our model.\n",
       "We need to calculate the loss for each one of those parameters.\n",
       "So we do this loss.backwards to backpropagate\n",
       "through all of those different values and get that loss.\n",
       "After we've done that, we use our optimizer, take a step,\n",
       "and optimize all those parameters based on that loss.\n",
       "Then that's everything we need to train the model.\n",
       "And there's just a few things.\n",
       "So for the progress bar, I just want\n",
       "a little bit of information there just so I know what's going on.\n",
       "And I just write loop set description.\n",
       "And I just want to print out the epoch.\n",
       "So write that.\n",
       "And then I want to set the postfix as well.\n",
       "So loop.set postfix.\n",
       "And here I just want to see the loss.\n",
       "So we'll just do loss item like that.\n",
       "So that should be everything.\n",
       "Yeah, let's run that, see what happens.\n",
       "Hopefully it should work.\n",
       "No, it didn't work.\n",
       "OK.\n",
       "Let me see.\n",
       "Oh, no, it's a CUDA error.\n",
       "So probably just need to refresh everything.\n",
       "I hate CUDA errors.\n",
       "One moment.\n",
       "OK, so finally figured it out.\n",
       "Took so long.\n",
       "So a few tips anyway.\n",
       "When you do get a CUDA error, switch your device to CPU,\n",
       "and then re-run everything.\n",
       "And you should get a more understandable error.\n",
       "So if we come down here, I've changed it to CPU.\n",
       "We see that we get an index error.\n",
       "Scroll down, index out of range itself.\n",
       "So the reason for this is, so you get this error\n",
       "if you don't add the extra two tokens onto the end of here.\n",
       "But we added them.\n",
       "So I was pretty confused about that.\n",
       "And then it took me a really long time\n",
       "to realize that this argument is wrong.\n",
       "And there should be an S on the end.\n",
       "So that was the error.\n",
       "So yeah, super, super cool.\n",
       "That was literally it.\n",
       "It took me so long to figure that out.\n",
       "But now we have it.\n",
       "That's good.\n",
       "We just need to run everything again.\n",
       "So I'm just going to run through everything.\n",
       "Remove this cell here where I changed it to CPU,\n",
       "because I don't need it now.\n",
       "And just re-execute all that.\n",
       "OK, so we're back.\n",
       "And we've finished training our model now.\n",
       "Now, it has taken a long time.\n",
       "It's a few days later.\n",
       "And I made a few changes during training as well.\n",
       "So this definitely wasn't the cleanest training process,\n",
       "because I was kind of updating parameters as it was going along.\n",
       "So initially, well, first, we've trained\n",
       "for like three and a bit epochs.\n",
       "And I've trained on the full data set as well.\n",
       "So if I come up here, I think, do I print out\n",
       "how much data it was?\n",
       "Maybe in another file.\n",
       "So if we come down here, so yeah, there's a lot more data here.\n",
       "So we have 200, no, 20.\n",
       "Let me think, 2 million.\n",
       "OK, so 2 million samples in that final run.\n",
       "And initially, when we started training,\n",
       "we started with a learning rate of 1e to the minus 5.\n",
       "Now, I looked into this a little bit.\n",
       "And it just was not really moving.\n",
       "And I'll show you in a minute.\n",
       "So for the second epoch, I moved it down to 1e to the minus 4.\n",
       "Or moved it up, sorry, to 1e to the minus 4.\n",
       "And that moved, started moving things a lot quicker.\n",
       "So that was good.\n",
       "And then in total, like I said, it was three and a bit epochs.\n",
       "Other than that, I didn't really change anything.\n",
       "The only thing I did was I trained for one epoch\n",
       "at a time because I wanted to see how the results were\n",
       "looking after each epoch.\n",
       "And that was quite interesting.\n",
       "So let me show you that.\n",
       "OK, so this is after the first epoch.\n",
       "So here, what I'm doing is I've got this fill,\n",
       "which is a pipeline fill object.\n",
       "And I'm entering chow and then putting in now mass and then\n",
       "va.\n",
       "And I wanted to say chow, come here, va.\n",
       "And in the middle, I wouldn't have to predict come.\n",
       "Now, this is after the first epoch.\n",
       "And we can see it's not, yeah, it's just putting\n",
       "like random characters.\n",
       "So question mark here, three dots here, chow and chow again\n",
       "here.\n",
       "Kind of weird.\n",
       "So yeah, not the best, right?\n",
       "Then we move on to the second epoch.\n",
       "And it's getting, well, it's still rubbish.\n",
       "At least it's got words.\n",
       "So like here, we have a word, chow, kiva, or chiva.\n",
       "Kek, oh, chow, kiva.\n",
       "I don't know if that's the way I always, the C-H in Italian,\n",
       "I always get messed up.\n",
       "If there's any Italians watching, I'm sorry.\n",
       "Chow, kiva.\n",
       "At least we're getting words.\n",
       "But none of these, so it doesn't make any sense.\n",
       "OK, so no, still not good.\n",
       "Now, if we come across again, so this is this one.\n",
       "Yeah, this one.\n",
       "Now we get it.\n",
       "So the rest of them are nonsense.\n",
       "OK, so the four here, ignore them.\n",
       "However, at the top, we get this score of 0.33.\n",
       "And we get chow, kiva.\n",
       "So that's what we wanted.\n",
       "So that's good.\n",
       "It means it's working.\n",
       "This was after the third and a bit epoch.\n",
       "Let me show you the loss function as well.\n",
       "So this, I know this is really messy.\n",
       "So here we have our, I don't know why this one's so short,\n",
       "actually.\n",
       "Why is that one so short?\n",
       "Strange, maybe I didn't.\n",
       "Yeah, for the last one, it doesn't\n",
       "look like I finished training for the full epoch.\n",
       "So I thought I did.\n",
       "Maybe something happened.\n",
       "I'm not sure.\n",
       "But fine, that's what it is.\n",
       "That's fine.\n",
       "So the first set of training I did was here.\n",
       "And you see in the middle, my computer\n",
       "went to sleep for a bit overnight\n",
       "because it was just so loud.\n",
       "So I turned it off for a bit.\n",
       "And then continue going down.\n",
       "Now, this first epoch is when we were at 1.0 or 1e to the minus 5.\n",
       "And then here, I was testing the 1e to the minus 4.\n",
       "And you can see straight away, it goes down way quicker.\n",
       "So I was like, OK, we're going to go with that.\n",
       "It's clearly a lot better.\n",
       "And then continued over here, the next epoch,\n",
       "and then the final one here, which didn't\n",
       "seem to change much anyway.\n",
       "But there was still a pretty clear difference.\n",
       "So that's the loss over time.\n",
       "And yeah, I mean, we've seen the results from that.\n",
       "So now we have that.\n",
       "Let's move on to actually testing the model.\n",
       "So I'm going to bring Lara in.\n",
       "I'm going to just open the file.\n",
       "OK, so this is the testing we're going to do.\n",
       "So we're using the file mask.\n",
       "We've got this pipeline.\n",
       "Sorry, fill mask.\n",
       "I've got this pipeline.\n",
       "And what I'm going to do is just get Lara\n",
       "to come in and some Italian sentences\n",
       "and just add this random mask token in\n",
       "and see if the results are bearable or not.\n",
       "So let's see.\n",
       "So I will see you in a minute.\n",
       "This is Lara.\n",
       "She can speak Italian.\n",
       "So she's going to go through this and test it a few times\n",
       "and hopefully say it's good.\n",
       "Let's see.\n",
       "Hopefully.\n",
       "Ciao.\n",
       "OK, so all you need to do is we have a sentence here.\n",
       "And you just write some Italian.\n",
       "And then for one of the words in there,\n",
       "we want to replace it with this text here.\n",
       "And then that's going to mask that word.\n",
       "And then the model is going to try and predict what is there.\n",
       "And hopefully it will predict.\n",
       "Let's see.\n",
       "So just write some Italian phrase.\n",
       "Not too difficult yet.\n",
       "And see.\n",
       "So I don't have to write, ciao, va?\n",
       "No, no, no, no.\n",
       "You write.\n",
       "Just write a sentence.\n",
       "And we'll do that.\n",
       "Buongiorno, gente.\n",
       "No, buongiorno.\n",
       "Maybe a few words there.\n",
       "Can I put comma or dots?\n",
       "Yeah, you can put comma.\n",
       "Buongiorno, come va?\n",
       "OK.\n",
       "And then, so which word should we cover?\n",
       "Come?\n",
       "OK.\n",
       "And then.\n",
       "OK, so just cover it with the mask.\n",
       "And see what it says.\n",
       "So not this.\n",
       "I seem to read on these as well.\n",
       "OK, so let's give it a moment.\n",
       "Chi va?\n",
       "Yeah, but the second one, come va?\n",
       "Come va.\n",
       "Almost there.\n",
       "Does chi va mean anything?\n",
       "Like who?\n",
       "Yeah, it's like, is there someone?\n",
       "But I understand because I'm Italian,\n",
       "but I don't think that we don't usually say that.\n",
       "I don't think.\n",
       "I'm going to take that as fine.\n",
       "I'm going to take that as it's good.\n",
       "So let's do it again, maybe.\n",
       "Yeah.\n",
       "Try another one.\n",
       "Oh, wait, actually, what about these ones?\n",
       "Cos'va, no, non'va definitely not right.\n",
       "No.\n",
       "Che'va?\n",
       "No.\n",
       "No, OK.\n",
       "But it's just like after buongiorno,\n",
       "I wouldn't expect.\n",
       "Chi va?\n",
       "Chi va.\n",
       "Yeah, that's OK.\n",
       "So you can just put another one like where we put Phil again.\n",
       "You can write another sentence.\n",
       "So we're here.\n",
       "Yeah.\n",
       "So we can write.\n",
       "Yeah.\n",
       "Yeah, and then what do you want to replace?\n",
       "Incontriamo, maybe?\n",
       "Or dove as well.\n",
       "OK.\n",
       "Yeah.\n",
       "So which one?\n",
       "You decide.\n",
       "It's fine.\n",
       "Incontriamo is interesting.\n",
       "OK, let's try.\n",
       "Yeah, yeah.\n",
       "Oh, look at that.\n",
       "Yeah, that's good.\n",
       "Dove ci vediamo oggi pomeriggio?\n",
       "Dove ci incontriamo oggi pomeriggio?\n",
       "Dove ci siamo oggi pomeriggio?\n",
       "No.\n",
       "No.\n",
       "Dove ci troviamo oggi pomeriggio?\n",
       "Dove ci ritroviamo?\n",
       "Yeah, that's quite good.\n",
       "Yeah.\n",
       "OK.\n",
       "Should we try with dove?\n",
       "Like using the same phrase.\n",
       "Yeah, yeah.\n",
       "Try.\n",
       "You can do it.\n",
       "OK.\n",
       "You can control Z, right?\n",
       "Yeah.\n",
       "OK, let's run it.\n",
       "Dove, the second one.\n",
       "Come ci incontriamo quando ci incontriamo is good.\n",
       "Si.\n",
       "That's cool.\n",
       "Yeah, cosa, se.\n",
       "Let's try another one.\n",
       "Yeah.\n",
       "Yeah.\n",
       "Cosa, pripare, che cena stacera.\n",
       "OK.\n",
       "Let's remove pripare.\n",
       "Yeah.\n",
       "Control Z.\n",
       "Yeah.\n",
       "Go.\n",
       "Run it.\n",
       "Yeah.\n",
       "Cosa fare per cena stacera, that's good.\n",
       "Cosa serve per cena stacera, yeah.\n",
       "Cosa aspetta per cena stacera, ni.\n",
       "No.\n",
       "Cosa succede per cena stacera, ni.\n",
       "Cosa vedere per cena stacera, ni.\n",
       "So I didn't find what we said before,\n",
       "which was cosa, pripare per cena stacera.\n",
       "Yeah.\n",
       "But does it make sense?\n",
       "Yeah, it makes sense.\n",
       "Cosa fare per cena stacera, cosa serve per cena stacera, si.\n",
       "Try something hard, like grammatically difficult.\n",
       "Mm.\n",
       "Cosa succederebbe.\n",
       "Is it hard?\n",
       "No, I'm thinking, I don't, when it's like that, you know,\n",
       "I don't know, like, doesn't come to my mind.\n",
       "Cosa se avesse scelto un altro giorno?\n",
       "Okay.\n",
       "Yeah.\n",
       "And then what should we replace?\n",
       "Avessimo.\n",
       "Avessimo.\n",
       "Avess...\n",
       "How do you say?\n",
       "Avessimo.\n",
       "Si.\n",
       "Avessimo.\n",
       "Avessimo.\n",
       "What does that mean?\n",
       "If we had.\n",
       "Avessi, avessi, avessero.\n",
       "Not, not the same one.\n",
       "No, but it's good because avessimo, it's for third person plural.\n",
       "It's like we had.\n",
       "Avessi is third person singular.\n",
       "So if he had or she had.\n",
       "Yeah.\n",
       "Chosen something different.\n",
       "What does this actually mean, cosa?\n",
       "So what would have happened if we had chosen another day?\n",
       "Ah.\n",
       "So the first one, se avesse scelto, it will be the third person.\n",
       "Uh-huh.\n",
       "Se avesse scelto, it will be the first person.\n",
       "So if I had chosen another day.\n",
       "Uh-huh.\n",
       "Se avessero, it's second person plural.\n",
       "So it will be if they had chosen another day.\n",
       "Uh-huh.\n",
       "Se ave...\n",
       "This one no.\n",
       "Se ave...\n",
       "Yeah.\n",
       "This is good, se venisse scelto, as well.\n",
       "Uh-huh.\n",
       "No, maybe no.\n",
       "But the first three are very good.\n",
       "Yeah.\n",
       "I have an idea.\n",
       "So now if we change to se...\n",
       "So if we put se loro, so if we specify the person, maybe we'll take the correct one.\n",
       "So if we put se loro.\n",
       "And then we expect it to say avessemo?\n",
       "Avesero.\n",
       "Avesero.\n",
       "Avesero.\n",
       "So let's run it.\n",
       "Avesero.\n",
       "You see?\n",
       "That's cool.\n",
       "That's very good.\n",
       "And then the other one, se loro anno, is right?\n",
       "Ave anno?\n",
       "I mean, I'm saying...\n",
       "Well, the verb is incorrect, but...\n",
       "Yeah, it's in the wrong place, but it's saying the right...\n",
       "Like the meaning is correct, but the grammar, it's not correct.\n",
       "Okay.\n",
       "Right, okay.\n",
       "Yeah.\n",
       "It's cool.\n",
       "You're welcome.\n",
       "Not happy it actually worked, because I wasn't sure if I could just...\n",
       "Well, it worked with ciao coming back, but that was all I tested it with, so I was a little bit worried that it might not do anything else.\n",
       "But thank you.\n",
       "You're welcome.\n",
       "Bye.\n",
       "Okay, so I think that's a pretty good result.\n",
       "So, I mean, that's pretty much everything we needed for building our model, our transform model.\n",
       "Although I do want to... so we're going to do one more video after this, where we're going to upload our model to the Hugging Face model hub.\n",
       "And then what we'll be able to do is actually download it directly from Hugging Face, which I think will be super cool to do that and figure out how we actually put all that together.\n",
       "So, yeah, I think good result.\n",
       "I'm pretty happy with that.\n",
       "And thank you for watching.\n",

       "I'm going to take you through a few different indexes in FIAS today.\n",
       "So FIAS for similarity search.\n",
       "And we're going to learn how we can decide which index to use based on our data.\n",
       "Now, these indexes are reasonably complex,\n",
       "but we're going to just have a high level look at each one of them.\n",
       "At some point in the future, we'll go into more depth for sure.\n",
       "But for now, this is what we're going to do.\n",
       "So we're going to cover the indexes that you see on the screen at the moment.\n",
       "So we have the flat indexes, which are just the plain and simple,\n",
       "nothing special going on there.\n",
       "And then we're going to have a look at LSH or locality sensitive hashing,\n",
       "HNSW, which is hierarchical navigable small worlds.\n",
       "And then finally, we're going to have a look at an IVF index as well.\n",
       "So first thing I'm going to show you is how to get some data for following through this.\n",
       "So we're going to be using the SIFT 1M dataset,\n",
       "which is one million vectors that we can use for testing similarity.\n",
       "Now, there's a little bit of code, so I'm just going to show it to you.\n",
       "So we have here, we're just downloading the code.\n",
       "There'll be a notebook for this in the description as well.\n",
       "So you can just use that and copy things across.\n",
       "But we're downloading it from here and this will give us a tar file.\n",
       "So we download that.\n",
       "And then here, all we're doing is extracting all the files from inside that tar file.\n",
       "And then here, I'm reading everything into the notebook.\n",
       "So inside that tar file, we'll get these FVEX files\n",
       "and we have to open them in a certain way, which is what we're doing here.\n",
       "So we're setting up the function to read them, sorry, here.\n",
       "And then here, I'm reading in two files.\n",
       "So we get a few different files here.\n",
       "So I'm sorry, this should be SIFT.\n",
       "So we get the base data, which is going to be the data that we're going to search through.\n",
       "And then we also have query data here.\n",
       "And then what I'm doing here is just selecting a single query,\n",
       "a single vector to query with rather than all of them,\n",
       "because we get quite a few in there.\n",
       "And then here, we can just see.\n",
       "So this is our query vector that gets Q.\n",
       "And then we also have WB here, which is going to be the data that we'll index and search through.\n",
       "And we can see some of it there as well.\n",
       "So that's how we get data.\n",
       "Let's move on to some flat indexes.\n",
       "So what you can see at the moment is a sort of a visual representation of a flat L2 index.\n",
       "Now up here, this is what we're doing.\n",
       "So we're calculating, we have all these points.\n",
       "So these are all of the WB points that we saw before.\n",
       "And this is our query vector.\n",
       "And we just calculate the distance between all of those.\n",
       "And then what we do is just take the top three.\n",
       "So the top K in reality, but in this case, it's top three.\n",
       "Now, we also have IP.\n",
       "So we have both L2 distance and IP distance as well.\n",
       "IP works in a different way.\n",
       "So we're using a different format to actually calculate the distance or similarity there.\n",
       "So it's not exactly as you see it here.\n",
       "But before we write any code, just want to say with flat indexes, they are 100% quality.\n",
       "And typically what we want to do with FI's and similarity search indexes is balance the\n",
       "search quality versus the search speed.\n",
       "Higher search quality, usually slower search speed.\n",
       "And flat indexes are just pure search quality because they are an exhaustive search.\n",
       "They check the distance between your query vector and every other vector in the index,\n",
       "which is fine if you don't have a particularly big data set or you don't care about time.\n",
       "But if you do, then you probably don't want to use that because it can take an incredibly\n",
       "long time.\n",
       "If you have a billion vectors in your data set and you do 100 queries a minute, then\n",
       "as far as I know, it's impossible to run that.\n",
       "And if you were going to run that, you'd need some pretty insane hardware.\n",
       "So we can't use flat indexes and exhaustive search in most cases.\n",
       "But I will show you how to do it.\n",
       "So first, I'm just going to define dimensionality of our data, which is 128, which we can see\n",
       "up here, 128.\n",
       "I'm also going to say how many, so how many results do we want to return?\n",
       "I'm going to say 10.\n",
       "Okay.\n",
       "We also need to import FI's before we do anything.\n",
       "And then we can initialize our index.\n",
       "So I said we have two.\n",
       "So we have FI's index flat 02 or IP.\n",
       "I'm going to use IP because it's very slightly faster.\n",
       "It seems from me testing it, it's very slightly faster, but there's hardly any difference\n",
       "in reality.\n",
       "So initializes our index and then we want to add our data to it.\n",
       "So we add WB and then we perform a search.\n",
       "So let me create a new cell and let me just run this quickly.\n",
       "Okay.\n",
       "And what I'm going to do is just time it so you can see how long this takes as well.\n",
       "So I'm going to do time and we're going to do index or sorry, DI equals index search.\n",
       "And in here we have our query vector and how many samples we'd like to return.\n",
       "So I'm going to go with K.\n",
       "Okay.\n",
       "So that was reasonably quick and that's because we don't have a huge data set and we're just\n",
       "searching for one query.\n",
       "So it's not really too much of a problem there.\n",
       "But what I do want to show you is, so if we print out I that returns all of the IDs or\n",
       "the indexes of the 10 most similar vectors.\n",
       "Now I'm going to use that as a baseline for each of our other indexes.\n",
       "So this is, like I said, 100% quality and we can use this accuracy to test out other\n",
       "indexes as well.\n",
       "So what I'm going to do is take that and convert it into a list.\n",
       "And if we just have a look at what we get, we see that we get a list like that.\n",
       "And we're just going to use that, like I said, to see how our other indexes are performing.\n",
       "So we'll move on to the other indexes.\n",
       "And like I said before, we want to try and go from this, which is the flat indexes, which\n",
       "is 100% search quality to something that's more 50-50.\n",
       "But it depends on our use case as well.\n",
       "Sometimes we might want more speed, sometimes higher quality.\n",
       "So we will see a few of those through these indexes.\n",
       "So we start with LSH.\n",
       "So a very high level.\n",
       "LSH works by grouping vectors in two different buckets.\n",
       "Now what we can see on the screen now is a typical hashing function for like a Python\n",
       "dictionary.\n",
       "And what these hashing functions do is they try to minimize collisions.\n",
       "So collision is where we would have the case of two items, maybe say these two, being hashed\n",
       "into the same bucket.\n",
       "And with a dictionary, you don't want that because you want every bucket to be an independent\n",
       "value.\n",
       "Otherwise, it increases the complexity of extracting your values from a single bucket\n",
       "if they've collided.\n",
       "Now LSH is slightly different because we actually do want to group things.\n",
       "So we can see it as a dictionary.\n",
       "But rather than where before we were avoiding those collisions, you can see here we're putting\n",
       "them into completely different buckets every time.\n",
       "Rather than doing that, we're trying to maximize collisions.\n",
       "So you can see here that we've pushed all three of these keys into this single bucket\n",
       "here.\n",
       "And we've also pushed all of these keys into this single bucket.\n",
       "So we get groupings of our values.\n",
       "Now when it comes to performing our search, we process our query through the same hashing\n",
       "function and that will push it to one of our buckets.\n",
       "Now in the case of maybe appearing in this bucket here, we use Hamming Distance to find\n",
       "the nearest bucket and then we can search or we restrict our scope to these values.\n",
       "So we just restricted our scope there, which means that we do not need to search through\n",
       "everything.\n",
       "We are avoiding searching through those values down there.\n",
       "Now let's have a look at how we implement that.\n",
       "So it's pretty straightforward.\n",
       "All we do is index, we do vise index LSH.\n",
       "We have our dimensionality and then we also have this other variable which is called nbits.\n",
       "So I will put that in a variable up here.\n",
       "Do nbits and what I'm going to do is I'm going to make it d multiplied by 4.\n",
       "So nbits we will have to scale with the dimensionality of our data which comes into another problem\n",
       "which I'll mention later on which is the curse of dimensionality.\n",
       "But I'll talk more about it in a moment.\n",
       "So here we have nbits and then we add our data like we did before and then we can search\n",
       "our data just like we did before.\n",
       "So time and we do d pi equals index search and we are searching using our query, our\n",
       "search query and we want to return 10 items.\n",
       "So quicker speed, see here.\n",
       "And what we can also do is compare the results to our 100% quality index or flat index and\n",
       "we do that using numpy in 1D baseline i.\n",
       "Okay so I'm just going to look at it visually here so we can see we have quite a lot of\n",
       "matches here.\n",
       "So plenty of trues, couple of falses, true, false, false, false.\n",
       "So these are the top 10 that have been returned using our LSH algorithm and we're checking\n",
       "if they exist in the baseline results that we got from our flat index earlier and we're\n",
       "returning that most of them are present in that baseline.\n",
       "So most of them do match so it's a reasonably good recall there.\n",
       "So that's good and it was faster.\n",
       "So we've got 17.6 milliseconds here.\n",
       "How much did we get up here?\n",
       "We got 157 milliseconds.\n",
       "So slightly less accurate but what is that 10 times faster so it's pretty good.\n",
       "And we can mess around with n bits.\n",
       "We can increase it to increase the accuracy of our index or we decrease it to increase\n",
       "the speed.\n",
       "So again it's just trying to find that balance between them both.\n",
       "Okay so this is a graph just showing you the recalls with different n bit values.\n",
       "So as we sort of saw before we increase the n bits value for good recall but at the same\n",
       "time we have that curse of dimensionality.\n",
       "So if we are multiplying our dimensionality value d by 8 in order to get a good recall\n",
       "then if we have a dimensionality of 4 that's not a very high number so it's going to be\n",
       "reasonably fast but if we increase that to dimensionality for example 512 that becomes\n",
       "very, very complex very quickly.\n",
       "So you have to be careful with your dimensionality.\n",
       "Lower dimensionality is very good for LSH otherwise it's not so good.\n",
       "You can see that here so at the bottom here I've used this is on the same data set so\n",
       "an n bits value of d multiplied by 2 with LSH it's super fast.\n",
       "It's faster than our flat index which is what you would hope but if we increase the n bits\n",
       "value quite a bit so maybe you want very high performance then it gets out of hand very\n",
       "quickly and our search time just grows massively.\n",
       "So you kind of have to find that balance but what we got before was pretty good.\n",
       "We had a d multiplied by 4 I think and we got reasonable performance and it was fast\n",
       "so it's good.\n",
       "And that also applies to the index size as well so lower n bits size index size isn't\n",
       "too bad.\n",
       "With higher n bits it's pretty huge so also something to think about.\n",
       "Now let's move on to HNSW.\n",
       "Now HNSW is what first part of it is NSW which is Navigo Small World Graphs.\n",
       "Now what makes a graph small world it essentially means that this graph can be very large but\n",
       "the number of hops so the number of steps you need to take between any two vertexes\n",
       "which is the points is very low so in this example here we have this vertex over here\n",
       "and to get over to this one on the opposite side we need to take 1, 2, 3, 4 hops and this\n",
       "is obviously a very small network so it doesn't really count but you can see this sort of\n",
       "behaviour in very large networks so I think in 2016 there was a study from Facebook and\n",
       "at that point I don't remember the exact number of people that they had on the platform but\n",
       "I think it's in the billions and they found that the average number of hops that you need\n",
       "to take between any two people on the platform is like 3.6 so that's a very good example\n",
       "of a Navigo Small World Graph.\n",
       "Now hierarchical NSW graphs which is what we are using they're built in the same way\n",
       "like a NSW graph but then they're split across multiple layers which is what you can see\n",
       "here and when we are performing our search the path it takes will hop between different\n",
       "layers in order to find our nearest neighbour.\n",
       "Now it's pretty complicated and this is really I think over simplifying it a lot but that's\n",
       "the general gist of it I'm not going to go any further into it we will I think in a future\n",
       "video and article.\n",
       "Now let's put that together in code.\n",
       "So we have a few different variables here we have M which I'm going to set to 16 and\n",
       "M is the number of connections that each vertex has so of course that means greater connectivity\n",
       "we're probably going to find our nearest neighbours more accurately.\n",
       "EF search which is how what is the depth of our search every time we perform a search\n",
       "so we can set this to a higher value if we want to search more the network or a low value\n",
       "if we want to search less of the network obviously low values can be quicker high value can be\n",
       "more accurate.\n",
       "And then we have EF construction now this similar to EF search is how much of the network\n",
       "will we search but not during the actual search during the construction of the network.\n",
       "So this is essentially how efficiently and accurately are we going to build the network\n",
       "in the first place.\n",
       "So this will increase the add time but the search time it makes no difference on so it's\n",
       "good to use a high number I think for this one.\n",
       "So initialise our index and we have is FICE index HNSW flat so we can use different vectors\n",
       "here that we can I think PQ PQ there and essentially what that's going to do is make this search\n",
       "faster but slightly less accurate.\n",
       "Now this is already really fast with flats and that's all we're going to stick with but\n",
       "again like I said we will return to this at some point in future and cover it in a lot\n",
       "more detail for sure.\n",
       "So dimensionality we need to pass in our M value here as well.\n",
       "Now we want to apply those two parameters so we have EF search which is obviously EF\n",
       "search and then we also have HNSW the obviously the EF construction.\n",
       "So that should be everything ready to go and all we want to do now is add our data.\n",
       "So index.add WB.\n",
       "Okay now like I said we have that EF construction we use a reasonably high value so you can\n",
       "see this is already taking a lot longer than the previous indexes to actually add our vectors\n",
       "into it but it's still not going to take that long.\n",
       "And then once it is done we are going to do our search just like we did every other time\n",
       "so we have DI equals search sorry index.search and we are going to pass in our query and\n",
       "also K.\n",
       "Okay so 43.6 seconds to add the vectors there so a fair bit longer but then look at this\n",
       "super fast like that 3.7 milliseconds.\n",
       "So much faster than the last one I think the last one was 16 milliseconds right.\n",
       "Okay this is a flat index 157 LSH we have 17.6 okay so really quick which is cool.\n",
       "But how's the performance so let's have a look.\n",
       "Okay so we get quite a few false's here and only a couple of true's so okay it's not so\n",
       "great it was really fast but it's not very accurate but fortunately we can fix that so\n",
       "let's increase our EF search I'm going to increase it a fair bit let's go 32.32.\n",
       "This is probably I would imagine more than enough to get good performance so run this\n",
       "and run this.\n",
       "Okay and now we see we get pretty good results.\n",
       "Now the war time is higher so it's just a case of balancing it because this is now higher\n",
       "than LSH but what we can do is increase EF construction time the value of EF construction\n",
       "increases or decreases depending on what you want.\n",
       "There's a lot of flexibility with this and it can be really fast this is HNSW is essentially\n",
       "one of the best performing indexes that you can use if you look at the current state of\n",
       "the art a lot of them are HNSW or they're based on HNSW in some way or another.\n",
       "So these are good ones good ones to go with you just need to play around them a little\n",
       "bit.\n",
       "So this is a few of the performance I found using the same data set but I'm messing around\n",
       "so we have the EF construction values down here so start with 16 over here up to 64 EF\n",
       "search values over here and our M values over here.\n",
       "And we've got pretty good recall over 64 on the EF construction so EF construction is\n",
       "a really good one to just increase because it doesn't increase your search time which\n",
       "is pretty cool I think.\n",
       "And then here is the search time again for HNSW M and EF search obviously I didn't include\n",
       "EF construction there because it doesn't make a difference.\n",
       "And that's this is the one thing with HNSW the index size is absolutely huge so that's\n",
       "just one thing to bear in mind the index size can take a lot of memory but otherwise really\n",
       "really cool index.\n",
       "And then that leaves us on to our final index which is the IVF index and this is super popular\n",
       "and with good reasons it is very good.\n",
       "So the inverted file index is based on essentially clustering data points so you see here we\n",
       "have all of these different data points the little crosses and then we have these three\n",
       "other points which are going to be our cluster centroids.\n",
       "So around each or based in each of our centroids we expand a catchment radius around each of\n",
       "those and as you can see here where each of those circles collides it creates the edge\n",
       "of what are going to be our almost like catchment cells.\n",
       "This is called a Voronoi diagram or try it's a really hard word Dirichlet tessellation\n",
       "I don't know if that's correct but it sounds I think it sounds pretty cool so I thought\n",
       "I'd throw that in there.\n",
       "So we create these cells in each one of those cells any data point within those cells will\n",
       "be allocated to that given centroid and then when you search within a specific cell you\n",
       "pass your XQ value in there and that will be compared the XQ value will be compared\n",
       "to every single cluster centroid but not the other values within that cluster or the other\n",
       "clusters only the cluster centroids and then from that you find out which centroid is the\n",
       "closest to your query vector and then what we do is we restrict our search scope to only\n",
       "the data points within that cluster or that cell and then we calculate the nearest vector\n",
       "so at this point we have all the vectors only within that cell and we compare all of those\n",
       "to our query vector.\n",
       "Now there is one problem with this which is called the edge problem.\n",
       "Now we're just showing this in two-dimensional space obviously in reality for example the\n",
       "data set we're using we have 128 dimensions so dimensionally the edge problem is kind\n",
       "of complicated when you think about it in the hundreds of dimensions but what this is\n",
       "is so with say with our query we find our query vectors right on the edge of one of\n",
       "the cells and if we sell n probe value so I mentioned n probe here that's how many\n",
       "cells we search if that is set to one it means that we're going to restrict our search to\n",
       "only that cell even though if you if you look at this we have two or we have I'm trying\n",
       "to think so this one for sure is closer to our query vector than any of the magenta data\n",
       "points and possibly also this one and this one but and maybe even this one but we're\n",
       "not going to consider any of those because we're restricting our search only to this\n",
       "cell so we're only going to look at you know these data points and also these over here\n",
       "so that's that's the edge problem but we can get around that by not just searching one\n",
       "cell but by searching quite a few so in this case our n probe value is eight and that means\n",
       "we're going to search eight of the nearest centroids or centroid cells and that's how\n",
       "IVF works let's go ahead and implement that in code so first thing we need to do is sell\n",
       "n list value which is the number of centroids that we will have within our within our data\n",
       "and then this time so this is a little bit different we need to set the the final vector\n",
       "search that we're going to do so we're this is kind of split into two different operations\n",
       "right so we're searching based on clusters and then we're actually comparing the full\n",
       "vectors within the selected clusters so we need to define how we're going to do that\n",
       "final that final search between our full vectors and our query vector so what we do is write\n",
       "vice so do index flat we're going to index five p you can use l2 as well we set our dimension\n",
       "it so we're just initializing a flat index there and then what we're going to do is feed\n",
       "that into our IVF index so our IVF index is vice index IVF and flat because we're using\n",
       "the flat indexes the flat vectors there we need to pass our quantizer so the this step\n",
       "here the other step to the search process the dimensionality and also our n list values\n",
       "of how many cells or clusters we're going to have in there and with this because we're\n",
       "clustering data we need to do something else so in fact let me show you so if we write\n",
       "index dot is trained we get this false if we wrote off any of our other indexes this\n",
       "would have been true because they don't need to be trained because we're not doing clustering\n",
       "or any other form of training or optimization there so what we need to do is we need to\n",
       "train our index before we use it so we write index train and we just pass all of our vectors\n",
       "into that but it's very quick so it's not really an issue and then we do index add pass\n",
       "our data and then what we do one thing so I want to show you we have our n probe value\n",
       "we'll search with one for now so we search one cell and to search we write di as we have\n",
       "every other time search execute okay okay so I mean super fast 3.32 milliseconds I think\n",
       "that's maybe the fastest other than how bad performing or low quality hsw index so let's\n",
       "see how how that's performed so you write mp dot in on d baseline hi you see it's not\n",
       "too bad to be fair like 50 50 almost so that's actually pretty good but what we can do if\n",
       "we want it to be even better is we increase the n probe value so let's go up to four so\n",
       "that's increased the wartime quite a bit so from like three to 125 which is now super\n",
       "slow actually but now we're getting perfect results we can maybe decrease that to two\n",
       "so now it's faster that could have been a one-off sometimes occasionally you get a really\n",
       "slow search and just happens sometimes so this is so we set n probe to super fast and\n",
       "super accurate so that that's a very good index as well so these are the stats I got\n",
       "in terms of recall and search time in milliseconds for different n probe values and different\n",
       "endless values so again it's all it's just about balancing it again index size the only\n",
       "thing that affects your index size here is obviously the size of your data and the endless\n",
       "value but you can increase the endless value loads and the index size hardly increases\n",
       "so this is like increasing by 100 kilobytes per like double of the endless value so this\n",
       "is very it's like nothing so that's it for this video and we covered quite a lot so I'm\n",
       "gonna leave it there but I think these all these indexes are super useful and quite interesting\n",
       "and figuring out just playing around with them like you see I've done loads with these\n",
       "these graphs just seeing what is faster what is slower what where the good quality is I'm\n",
       "just playing around the parameters and seeing what you can get out of it is super useful\n",
       "for actually understanding these now what I do want to do going forward is actually\n",
       "explore each one of these indexes in more depth because you've only covered them like\n",
       "very very very high level at the moment so in future videos articles we're going to go\n",
       "into more depth and explore them a lot more so that we pretty interesting I think so that's\n",

       "So Flare is an incredibly simple, easy to use library, which contains a load of pre-built models for NLP\n",
       "that we can simply import and use to make predictions.\n",
       "So it actually allows us to use some of the most powerful models out there as well.\n",
       "So in this tutorial, we're going to be using the Distilbert model, which is based on a BERT, but it's a lot smaller,\n",
       "but almost as powerful as BERT itself.\n",
       "So we're going to go ahead and begin.\n",
       "First, if you haven't already, you need to pip install Flare.\n",
       "And alongside Flare, you are also going to need PyTorch.\n",
       "If you haven't got PyTorch installed already, you'll need to head over to the PyTorch website.\n",
       "And they give you instructions on exactly what you need to install.\n",
       "So we come down to here and we can see, OK, for me, I have Windows.\n",
       "I want to install using Conda, using Python and then CUDA.\n",
       "So this is if you have a CUDA enabled GPU on your machine.\n",
       "If you don't know what that means, you probably don't.\n",
       "So in that case, just click none.\n",
       "But for me, I have 10.2.\n",
       "So all we need to do is copy the command underneath here.\n",
       "And then we would run this in our Anaconda prompt.\n",
       "I already have these installed, so I'm going to go ahead and actually begin coding.\n",
       "So we're going to need to use Pandas and also Flare.\n",
       "So now we have imported Flare, we can actually import a sentiment model straight away.\n",
       "So all we need to do is pass our sentiment model to a variable.\n",
       "Which we will call sentiment model.\n",
       "And we just need to write Flare.models.textClassifier and load.\n",
       "And then in here, we pass the model name that we would like to load.\n",
       "And in our case, it will be the English sentiment model, which is en-sentiment.\n",
       "En-sentiment.\n",
       "Like so.\n",
       "OK, so now we are downloading the model.\n",
       "And in a moment that will have downloaded and we can begin using it.\n",
       "Now, obviously, we need data.\n",
       "I have downloaded some data here.\n",
       "Which is a sentiment data set based on the IMDB Movery reviews.\n",
       "So you can find the same data set over here.\n",
       "OK, so sentiment analysis on Movery reviews data set.\n",
       "So it's from Rotten Tomatoes.\n",
       "You can just scroll down and we have the training data and test data here.\n",
       "I'm just going to use the test data and build a test data set.\n",
       "I'm just going to use the test data, but we can use either.\n",
       "We're just going to be making predictions based on the phrase here.\n",
       "So we need to read in our data.\n",
       "So it's going to read it in as if it were a CSV file.\n",
       "And we will just pass a tab as our separator,\n",
       "because we are actually working with a tab separated file.\n",
       "OK, so here it's actually a CSV, not CSV.\n",
       "OK, so the first thing you'll notice is that we actually have duplicates of the same phrase.\n",
       "That is actually just how this data set is.\n",
       "It just contains the full phrase initially.\n",
       "So this first entry here is the full phrase.\n",
       "And then all of these following are actually parts of that phrase.\n",
       "So what we can do, so let's change it so we can actually see the full phrase first.\n",
       "OK, so we can't really see that much more anyway, but we can see that the full phrase\n",
       "has fine.\n",
       "So to remove this, we just want to drop all of the duplicates\n",
       "whilst keeping the first instance of the sentence ID.\n",
       "So you see each one of these, they all have the same sentence ID.\n",
       "It's actually only the first one that we need.\n",
       "So we just drop duplicates on this column, keeping the first entry.\n",
       "OK, so we're keeping the first entry, dropping duplicates from sentence ID,\n",
       "and we're just doing this operation in place.\n",
       "OK, so now we can see each sample is now a unique entry.\n",
       "OK, so now our data is ready.\n",
       "So we need to actually first convert our text into a token as list using Flare.\n",
       "So Flare does this one sentence at a time. So if we, for example, pass\n",
       "Hello World into the Flare tokenizer, we will be able to see what it's actually doing.\n",
       "OK, so here we can see that it split each one of these into tokens.\n",
       "So we've got Hello is a token, World is a token, and then we have also split the\n",
       "exclamation mark at the end there.\n",
       "And you can see that Flare is telling us that there are a total of three tokens.\n",
       "So we can see that Flare is telling us that there are three tokens.\n",
       "So we can see that Flare is telling us that there are three tokens.\n",
       "And you can see that Flare is telling us that there are a total of three tokens there.\n",
       "So each one of our samples here will need to be processed by this Flare.data.sentence\n",
       "method before we pass it into the actual model.\n",
       "Once we do have this, so let's call this sample as well.\n",
       "We will pass it to our model for prediction.\n",
       "Which is really easy. All we need to do is call the predict method.\n",
       "On the sample.\n",
       "And now this doesn't output anything.\n",
       "Instead, it actually just modifies the sentence object that we have produced.\n",
       "So it modifies sample.\n",
       "And we can see now that our sample, we solved the sentence and we solved the number of tokens.\n",
       "But we also have these additional labels which are the predictions.\n",
       "We have the label which is positive, which means it's a happy or it's a positive sentiment.\n",
       "And then what we have here is actually the probability or the confidence in that prediction.\n",
       "That's great, but realistically we want to be extracting these labels.\n",
       "So we're actually able to extract these by accessing the labels method.\n",
       "So you have labels here and this produces the positive and the confidence.\n",
       "To access each one of these we access the positive and the confidence.\n",
       "We access index zero followed by dot value.\n",
       "Okay, so this will give us the positive.\n",
       "And then we can also do the same to get the confidence called the score.\n",
       "Like that.\n",
       "So what we can do now is just create a simple for loop that will go through each sample in our test\n",
       "data and assign a probability for each one.\n",
       "So we will initially create a sentiment and confidence list.\n",
       "And then we will just as we are looping through the data we will append our sentiment values.\n",
       "So the positive or negative and the confidence to each one of these lists.\n",
       "So here we are first tokenizing our sentence.\n",
       "Then we are making a prediction using that tokenized sentence which we are calling sample.\n",
       "And as we did before we have now got this labeled sentence and we just need to extract the two labels that we have here.\n",
       "Okay, so we can see here that one of our sentences was just blank so we will add in some logic to avoid any errors there.\n",
       "Okay, so looking at this it's also whenever there's a space as well.\n",
       "So we just need to trim this which we can do easily using the strip method.\n",
       "Okay, so it took a little bit of time but we now have our predictions.\n",
       "So what we want to do is actually add what we have here in the sentiment and confidence list to our data frame.\n",
       "So to do that we just add df sentiment to create a new sentiment column.\n",
       "And we made that equal to the sentiment list that we have created.\n",
       "And then we also do the same for confidence as well.\n",
       "Then we can see our data frame.\n",
       "Okay, so initially looking at this it looks pretty good.\n",
       "So intermittently pleasing but mostly routine effort.\n",
       "Incredibly negative but basically saying it's occasionally okay but generally nothing special.\n",
       "So obviously it's a negative sentiment which is matched up to negative sentiment here.\n",
       "Here we're saying okay Kidman's the only thing that's worth watching in birthday girl.\n",
       "And it serves as another example of the sad decline of British comedies in the post full monty world.\n",
       "Fair enough, also negative.\n",
       "So this one is our first positive.\n",
       "Once you get into it it's relevant.\n",
       "The movie becomes a heady experience.\n",
       "Yeah, I mean sounds pretty positive to me.\n",
       "So it's quite good even here where we're not saying anything particularly like a negative or positive word.\n",
       "We're just saying that the movie is or the movie delivers on the performance of striking skill and depth.\n",
       "Which must be pretty hard for a machine to understand and actually get right.\n",
       "But looking at all these it's doing really well.\n",
       "And I think it's really cool that we can actually do this with so little effort.\n",
       "And we've only actually written a few lines of code in reality.\n",
       "And it's producing really good accurate results which is really impressive to me.\n",
       "So that's it for this video.\n",

       "So for those of you that don't know, Q&A just means question answering and it's one of the biggest topics in NLP at the moment.\n",
       "There's a lot of models out there where you ask a question and it will give you an answer.\n",
       "And one of the biggest things that you need to know how to do when you are working with transformers,\n",
       "whether that's Q&A or any of the other transformer based solutions, is how to actually fine-tune those.\n",
       "So that's what we're going to be doing in this video. We're going to go through how we can fine-tune a Q&A Transformer model in Python.\n",
       "So I think it's really interesting and I think you will enjoy it a lot. So let's just go ahead and we can get started.\n",
       "Okay, so first thing we need to do is actually download our data.\n",
       "So we're going to be using the SQuAD dataset, which is the Stanford question answering dataset,\n",
       "which is essentially one of the better known Q&A datasets out there that we can use to fine-tune our model.\n",
       "So let's first create a folder.\n",
       "It's going to use OS and OSMaker.\n",
       "We'll just call it SQuAD. Obviously, call this and organize it as you want. This is what I will be doing.\n",
       "Now, the URL that we are going to be downloading this from is this.\n",
       "Okay, and there are actually two files here that we're going to be downloading, but both will be coming from the same URL.\n",
       "So because we're making a request through URL, we're going to import requests.\n",
       "We can also use the Wget library as well, or if you're on Linux, you can just use Wget directly in the terminal.\n",
       "It's up to you what we're going to be using requests.\n",
       "Okay, and to request our data, we're going to be doing this.\n",
       "So it's just a get request, use a FString, and we have the URL that we've already defined.\n",
       "And then the training data that we'll be using is this file here.\n",
       "Okay, requests. Okay, we can see that we've successfully put that data in there.\n",
       "Okay, so like I said before, there's actually two of these files that we want to extract.\n",
       "So what I'm going to do is just put this into a for loop, which will go through both of them.\n",
       "Just copy and paste this across.\n",
       "Rename this file.\n",
       "And the other file is the same, but instead of train, we have dev.\n",
       "Okay, so here we're making our request.\n",
       "And then next thing we want to do after making our request is actually saving this file to our drive.\n",
       "Okay, and we want to put that inside this squad folder here.\n",
       "So to do that, we use open.\n",
       "And again, we're going to use a string here.\n",
       "I want to put inside the squad folder here.\n",
       "And then here we are just going to put our file name, which is file.\n",
       "Now we're writing this in binary because it's JSON.\n",
       "So we put wb for our flags here.\n",
       "And then within this namespace, we are going to run through the file and download it in chunks.\n",
       "So we do for chunk.\n",
       "And then we iterate through the response.\n",
       "Like this.\n",
       "We'll just use a chunk size of four.\n",
       "And then we just want to write to the file like that.\n",
       "So that will download both files.\n",
       "Just add the colon there.\n",
       "So that will download both files.\n",
       "We should be able to see them here now.\n",
       "So in here we have data.\n",
       "We have essentially a lot of different topics.\n",
       "So the first one is Beyonce.\n",
       "And then in here, we will see, if we just come to here, we get a context.\n",
       "But alongside this context, we also have QAS, which is question and answers.\n",
       "And each one of these contains a question and answer pair.\n",
       "So we have this question, when did Beyonce start becoming popular?\n",
       "So this answer is actually within this context.\n",
       "And what we want our model to do is extract the answer from that context by telling us\n",
       "the start and end token of the answer within that context.\n",
       "So we go zero and it is in the late 1990s.\n",
       "And we have answer start 269.\n",
       "So that means that a character 269, we get I.\n",
       "So if we go through here, we can find it here.\n",
       "OK, so this is the extract.\n",
       "And that's what we will be aiming for our model to actually extract.\n",
       "But there will be a start point and also the end point as well, which is not included in here.\n",
       "But we will add that manually quite soon.\n",
       "So that's our data, and then we'll also be testing on the dev data as well,\n",
       "which is exactly the same.\n",
       "OK, so we move on to the data prep.\n",
       "So now we have our files here.\n",
       "We're going to want to read them in.\n",
       "So we're going to use the JSON library for that.\n",
       "And like we saw before, there's quite a complex structure in these JSONs.\n",
       "There's a lot of different layers.\n",
       "So we need to use a few for loops to fill through each of these and extract what we want,\n",
       "which is the context, questions and answers all corresponding to each other.\n",
       "So in the end, we're going to have a list of strings, which is going to be all of these.\n",
       "And in the case of the answers, we also have the starting position.\n",
       "So it will be a list of dictionaries where one value is a text and one value is the starting position.\n",
       "So to do that, we're going to define a function called Rebsquad.\n",
       "We'll define our path here as well.\n",
       "And the first thing we need to do is actually open the JSON file.\n",
       "So we do with open path.\n",
       "And again, we are using a binary file.\n",
       "So we're going to have B as a flag.\n",
       "But instead of writing, we are reading.\n",
       "So use R here.\n",
       "So RB.\n",
       "I'm just going to do JSON load F here.\n",
       "So now we have our dictionary within this squad dict here.\n",
       "So maybe whilst we're just building this function up, it's probably more useful to do it here.\n",
       "So we can see what we're actually doing.\n",
       "So let's copy that across.\n",
       "And then we'll fill this out afterwards.\n",
       "And then we'll fill this out afterwards.\n",
       "Of course, we do actually need to include the path.\n",
       "So let's take this.\n",
       "And now we can see what's inside here.\n",
       "Maybe we can load just a few rather than all of them.\n",
       "Or we can investigate it like this.\n",
       "Okay, so we have the version and data, which we can actually see over here.\n",
       "Version and data.\n",
       "So we want to access the data.\n",
       "And within data, we have a list of all these different items, which is what I was trying\n",
       "to do before.\n",
       "So we go into data and just take a few of those.\n",
       "Okay, and then we get our different sections.\n",
       "First one, let's just take zero, which is Beyonce.\n",
       "And then we have all of these.\n",
       "So we're going to want to loop through each one of these because we have\n",
       "this one, the next, and we're going to keep needing to just run through all of these.\n",
       "So let's do that.\n",
       "We want to do for group in squad dict.\n",
       "And remember, we need to include the data here.\n",
       "Let's just see how, say group title.\n",
       "So group title, so we can see a few of those.\n",
       "Okay, we're going to go through each one of those.\n",
       "So the second part of that are these paragraphs.\n",
       "And within the paragraphs, we have each one of our questions.\n",
       "So let's first go with paragraphs and we'll do a chop in here.\n",
       "Sorry, it's a list.\n",
       "There we go.\n",
       "And the first thing we need to extract is the easiest one, which is our context.\n",
       "However, that is also within a list.\n",
       "So now if we access the context, we get this.\n",
       "So we're essentially going to need to jump through or loop through each one of these here.\n",
       "Now we're going to access the paragraphs and loop through each one of those.\n",
       "And then here, we're going to access the context.\n",
       "So let's write that.\n",
       "So we already have one group here.\n",
       "So let's just stick with that.\n",
       "And we're going to run through the passage in the paragraphs.\n",
       "So already here, we're going through the for loop on this index.\n",
       "And now we're going to go through the for loop.\n",
       "And now we're going to go through a loop on this index.\n",
       "Let's keep that.\n",
       "So that means that we will be able to print the passage context.\n",
       "And there we go.\n",
       "So here we have all of our context.\n",
       "So that's one of our three items that we need to extract.\n",
       "Okay, so that's great.\n",
       "Let's put that all together.\n",
       "So we're going to take this, put it here.\n",
       "And then we have our context.\n",
       "Okay, that's great.\n",
       "But obviously for each context, we have a few different questions and answers.\n",
       "So we need to get those as well.\n",
       "Now, that requires us to go through another for loop.\n",
       "So let's go this passage.\n",
       "We need to go into the QAS key and loop through this list of question and answers.\n",
       "So we have this, and then we have our list.\n",
       "So another layer in our for loop will be for question answer in passage QAS.\n",
       "And then let's take a look at what we have there.\n",
       "Okay, great.\n",
       "So we have plausible answers, question and answers.\n",
       "So what we want in here is the question and answers.\n",
       "So question is our first one.\n",
       "Perfect.\n",
       "So we have the questions now.\n",
       "And then after we have extracted the question,\n",
       "we can move on to our answers.\n",
       "As we see here, the answers comes as another list.\n",
       "Now each one of these lists all just have one actual answer in there,\n",
       "which is completely fine.\n",
       "So we can access that in two ways.\n",
       "We can either loop through or we can access the zero value of that array.\n",
       "Either way, it doesn't matter.\n",
       "So all we need to do here\n",
       "is loop through those answers or if we want just go with QA answers 0.\n",
       "So in most cases, this should be completely fine.\n",
       "As we can see here, most of these question and then they have the answers dictionary.\n",
       "The question and then they have the answers dictionary, which is fine.\n",
       "However, some of these are slightly different.\n",
       "So if we scroll right down to the end here,\n",
       "see, okay, we have this which is talking about physics.\n",
       "And then rather than having our answers array, we have these plausible answers,\n",
       "which is obviously slightly different.\n",
       "And this is the case for a couple of those.\n",
       "So from what I've seen to state, it's like the best way to deal with this\n",
       "is simply to have a check.\n",
       "If there is a plausible answers key within the dictionary,\n",
       "we will include that as a check.\n",
       "Within the dictionary, we will include that as the answer\n",
       "rather than the actual answers dictionary.\n",
       "So to do that, all we need to do is check if QA keys contains plausible answers.\n",
       "If it does, we use that.\n",
       "Otherwise, we use answers.\n",
       "Okay.\n",
       "Then we use this one.\n",
       "Otherwise,\n",
       "we will use answers.\n",
       "So let's just add all of that into our for loop here.\n",
       "So we have our context, and then we want to loop through the question answers.\n",
       "And this is where we get our question.\n",
       "Then once we're here, we need to do something slightly different,\n",
       "which is this plausible answers.\n",
       "Okay.\n",
       "And then we use this access variable in order to define what we're going to loop through next.\n",
       "So here we go for answers.\n",
       "Answer, sorry, in QA access, because this will switch to implausible answers or answers.\n",
       "And then within this for loop, this is where we can begin adding this context, question, and answer\n",
       "to a list of questions, contexts, and answers that we still need to define up here.\n",
       "So each one of these is just going to be an empty list.\n",
       "And then all we do is copy this across,\n",
       "and we just append everything that we've extracted in this loop.\n",
       "And the context.\n",
       "And then we just add the context.\n",
       "And then we just add the context.\n",
       "And the context, question, and answer.\n",
       "And that should work.\n",
       "So now let's take a look at a few of our contexts.\n",
       "Okay, and we can see we have this and because we have multiple question and answers for each context,\n",
       "the context just repeat over and over again.\n",
       "But then we should see something slightly different when we go with answers.\n",
       "And questions.\n",
       "Okay, so that's great.\n",
       "We have our data in a reasonable format now.\n",
       "But we want to do this for both the training set and the validation set.\n",
       "So what we're going to do is just going to put this into a function like we were going to do before.\n",
       "Just read squad.\n",
       "So here we're going to read in our data, and then we run through it and transform it into our three lists.\n",
       "All we need to do now is actually return those three lists.\n",
       "And answers.\n",
       "So now what we're going to do is just go back to our training set.\n",
       "And we're going to do this for both the training set and the validation set.\n",
       "And answers. So now what we can do is execute this function for both our training and validation sets.\n",
       "So we're going to train context, questions and answers.\n",
       "Okay, so that is one of them.\n",
       "And we can just copy that.\n",
       "And we just want this to be our validation set.\n",
       "Like so.\n",
       "Okay, so that's great.\n",
       "We now have the training context and the validation context, which we can see right here.\n",
       "So here let's hope that there is a slight difference in what we see between both.\n",
       "Okay, great.\n",
       "That's what we would expect.\n",
       "Okay, so now we have our data almost in the right format.\n",
       "We just need to add the ending position.\n",
       "So we already have the start position if we take a look in our train answers.\n",
       "Okay, we have the answer start, but we also need the answer end.\n",
       "And that's not included within the data.\n",
       "So what we need to do here is actually define a function that will go through each one of our\n",
       "answers and context and figure out where that ending character actually is.\n",
       "And of course, we could just say, okay, it's the length of the text.\n",
       "We add that onto the answer start and we have our answer end.\n",
       "However, that unfortunately won't work because some of the\n",
       "answer starts are actually incorrect and they're usually off by one or two characters.\n",
       "So we actually need to go through and one, fix that and two, add our end indices.\n",
       "So to do that, we're just going to define a new function.\n",
       "It's going to be add end index.\n",
       "And here we will have our answers and the context.\n",
       "And then we're going to just feed these in.\n",
       "So first thing we do is loop through each answer and context pair.\n",
       "And then we extract something which is called the gold text, which is essentially the\n",
       "answer that we are looking for.\n",
       "It's called the golden text or gold text.\n",
       "So simply our answer and within that the text.\n",
       "So we are pulling this out here.\n",
       "So we should already know the starting index.\n",
       "So what we do here is simply pull that out as well.\n",
       "And then the end index ideally will be the start plus the length of the gold text.\n",
       "However, that's not always the case because like I said before, they can be off by one or two characters.\n",
       "So we need to add in some logic just to deal with that.\n",
       "So in our first case, let's assume that the characters are not off.\n",
       "So if context start to end.\n",
       "Start to end equals the gold text.\n",
       "This means everything is good and we don't need to worry about it.\n",
       "So we can modify the original dictionary and we can add answer end into there.\n",
       "And we made that equal to our end index.\n",
       "However, if that's not the case, that means we have a problem.\n",
       "It's one of those dodgy question answer pairs.\n",
       "And so this time what we can do is we'll add a else statement.\n",
       "So we're just going to go through when the position is off by one or two characters because\n",
       "it is not off by any more than that in the squad data set.\n",
       "Loop through each of those and we'll say, OK, if the context.\n",
       "And then in here, we need to add the start index and this again.\n",
       "So let's just copy and paste that across.\n",
       "Be easier.\n",
       "But this time we're checking to see if it is off by one or two characters.\n",
       "So just minus N.\n",
       "And it's always minus and it isn't shifted.\n",
       "It's always shifted to the left rather than shifted to the right.\n",
       "So that's this is fine.\n",
       "So in this case, the answer is off by end tokens.\n",
       "And so we need to update our answer start value and also add our answer end value.\n",
       "So start index minus N and we also have the end.\n",
       "So that's great.\n",
       "We can take that and we can apply it to our train and validation sets.\n",
       "So all we do here is call the function.\n",
       "And we just see train answers and train context.\n",
       "And of course, we can just copy this and do the same for our validation set.\n",
       "OK, perfect.\n",
       "So now if we have a quick look, we should be able to see that we have\n",
       "a few of these ending points as well.\n",
       "OK, so I think that looks pretty good.\n",
       "And that means we can move on to actually encoding our text.\n",
       "To tokenize or encode our text, this is where we bring in a BERT tokenizer.\n",
       "So we need to import the Transformers library for this.\n",
       "And from Transformers, we are going to import the Distilbert.\n",
       "So Distilbert is a smaller version of BERT, which is just going to run a bit quicker,\n",
       "but it will take a very long time.\n",
       "And we're going to import the FAST version of this tokenizer because this allows us to more\n",
       "easily adjust our character and then start locations to token and start locations later on.\n",
       "So first, we need to actually initialize our tokenizer, which is super easy.\n",
       "All we're doing is loading it from a pre-trained model.\n",
       "And then all we do to create our encodings is to load the\n",
       "tokenizer. So we'll do the training set first.\n",
       "Let's call it tokenizer.\n",
       "And in here, we include our training context.\n",
       "And the training questions.\n",
       "So what this will do\n",
       "is actually merge these two strings together.\n",
       "So what we will have is our context and then there will be a separator token\n",
       "followed by the question.\n",
       "And this will be fed into Distilbert during training.\n",
       "I just want to add padding there as well.\n",
       "And then we'll copy this and do the same for our relation set.\n",
       "Okay, and this will convert our data into encoding objects.\n",
       "So what we can do here is\n",
       "So what we can do here is print out different parts that we have within our\n",
       "encodings. So in here you have the input IDs so let's access that and you'll find\n",
       "in here we have a big list of all of our samples so check that we have\n",
       "130k and let's open one of those okay and we have these token IDs and this is\n",
       "what Bert will be reading. Now if we want to have a look at what this actually is\n",
       "in sort of human readable language we can use the tokenizer to just decode it for\n",
       "us. Okay this is what we're feeding in so we have a couple of these special\n",
       "tokens this just means it's the sort of sequence and in here we have a process\n",
       "form of our original context. Now you find that the context actually ends here\n",
       "and like I said before we have this separated token and then after that we\n",
       "have our actual question and this is what is being fed into Bert but obviously\n",
       "the token ID version. So it's just good to be aware of what is actually being\n",
       "fed in and what we're actually using here but this is a format that Bert is\n",
       "expecting and then after that we have another separated token followed by all\n",
       "of our padding tokens because Bert is going to be expecting 512 tokens to be\n",
       "fed in for every one sample so we just need to fill that space essentially so\n",
       "that's all that is doing. So let's remove those and we can continue. So the next\n",
       "thing we need to add to our encodings is the start and end positions because at the\n",
       "moment we just don't have them in there. So to do that we need to add a additional\n",
       "bit of logic. We use this character to token method so if we just take out one\n",
       "of these. Let's take the first one. Okay we have this and what we can do is\n",
       "actually modify this to use the character token method. Remove the input\n",
       "IDs because we just need to pass it the index of whichever encoding we are\n",
       "wanting to modify or get the start and end position of and in here all we're\n",
       "doing is converting from the character that we have found a position for to the\n",
       "token that we want to find a position for and what we need to add is train\n",
       "answers. We have our position again because the answers and encodings the\n",
       "context and question that needs to match up to the answer of course that we're\n",
       "asking about and we do answers start. So here we're just feeding in the position\n",
       "of the character and this is answer. Okay so feeding in the position of the character and\n",
       "we're expecting to return the position of the token which is position 64. So\n",
       "all we need to do now is do this for both of those so for the start position\n",
       "and end position. See here we should get a different value. Okay but this is one\n",
       "limitations of this. Sometimes this is going to return nothing as you can see\n",
       "it's not returning anything here and that is because sometimes it is actually\n",
       "returning the space and when it looks at the space and the tokenizer see\n",
       "that and they say okay that's nothing we're not concerned about spaces and it\n",
       "returns this non value that you can see here. So this is something that we need\n",
       "to consider and build in some added logic for. So to do that again we're\n",
       "going to use a function to contain all this and call it add token positions.\n",
       "Here we'll have our encodings and our answers and then we just modify this code so we have\n",
       "the encodings we have the answers and because we're collecting all of the\n",
       "token positions we also need to initialize a list to containers. So we\n",
       "do start positions empty list and end positions. And now we just want to loop\n",
       "through every single answer and encoding that we have. Like so. And here we have\n",
       "our start position so we need to append that to our start positions list.\n",
       "And we just do the same for our end positions which is here. Now here we can\n",
       "deal with this problem that we had. So if we find that the end positions the most\n",
       "recent one so the negative one index is non that means it wasn't found and it\n",
       "means there is a space. So what we do is we change it to instead use the minus one\n",
       "version. And all this needs to do is update the end positions here. Okay\n",
       "that's great but in some cases this also happens with the start position but that\n",
       "is for a different reason. The reason that will occasionally happen with start\n",
       "position is when the passage of data that we're adding in here so you saw\n",
       "before we had the context that separated token and then the question. Sometimes\n",
       "the context passage is truncated in order to fit in the question. So some of\n",
       "it will be cut off and in that case we do have a bit of a problem but we still\n",
       "need to just allow our code to run without any problems. So what we do is we\n",
       "just modify the start positions again just like we did with the end positions.\n",
       "Obviously only if it's a non and we just set it to be equal to the maximum length\n",
       "that has been defined by the tokenizer.\n",
       "It's as simple as that. Now the only final thing we need to do which is because we're\n",
       "using the encodings is actually update those encodings to include this\n",
       "data because as of yet we haven't added that back in. So to do that we can use\n",
       "this quite handy update method and just add in our data as a dictionary. So you\n",
       "have start positions, start positions and we also have our end positions. And then\n",
       "again we just need to apply this to our training and validation sets and let's\n",
       "just modify that.\n",
       "Let's add the training encodings here and train answers.\n",
       "We do that again the validation set.\n",
       "So now let's take a look at our encodings and here we can see great now\n",
       "have those start positions and end positions. We can even so a quick look\n",
       "what they look like.\n",
       "What we've done is actually not included the index here so we're just taking it</td>\n",

       "      <td id=\"T_39556_row4_col1\" class=\"data row4 col1\" >Hi, welcome to this video. We're going to have a look at Hugging Faces data sets library.\n",
       "We're going to have a look at some of what I think are the most useful data sets.\n",
       "And we're going to look at how we can use the library to build\n",
       "what I think are very good pipelines or data input pipelines for NLP. So let's get started.\n",
       "So the first thing we want to do is actually, well, install data sets. So we'll go\n",
       "clip install data sets and that will install the library for you.\n",
       "After this, we'll want to go ahead and import data sets.\n",
       "And then we can start having a look at which data sets are available to us.\n",
       "Now there's two ways that you can have a look at all of the data sets.\n",
       "The first one is using the data sets viewer, which you can find on Google.\n",
       "You just type in data sets viewer and it's just an interactive\n",
       "app which allows you to go through and have a look at the different data sets.\n",
       "Now I'm not going to, I've already spoken about that a lot before and it's super easy to use.\n",
       "So we're not going to go through it. Instead, we're just going to have a look at how we can\n",
       "have view everything in Python, which is the second option.\n",
       "So first we can do this. So we just list all of our data sets.\n",
       "Now I'm going to just write dslists here.\n",
       "And from this, we will just get, I think it's something like 1400 data sets now.\n",
       "So it's quite a lot. So if we go len of all dslists.\n",
       "So yeah, it's 1.4 thousand data sets, which is obviously a lot.\n",
       "And some of these are massive as well.\n",
       "So if we, for example, if we were to look at the Oscar data set,\n",
       "so in dslists, we could go data set for data set in dslists.\n",
       "If Oscar is in the data set. So these are just data set names.\n",
       "Okay, and we have Oscar, I think PT is, what is PT?\n",
       "I imagine it's probably Portuguese. And then we have all these other ones as well.\n",
       "But these are just, these are users uploaded Oscar data sets.\n",
       "This is the actual Oscar data set that's been sold by Hugging Face and it's huge.\n",
       "It contains, I think, more than 160 languages.\n",
       "And some of them, for example, English, obviously English is one of the biggest ones,\n",
       "that contains 1.2 terabytes of data.\n",
       "So there's a lot of data in there, but that's just unstructured text.\n",
       "What I want to have a look at is the squad data sets.\n",
       "Squad data sets. So we're going to be using, we're just going to use the original squad in this video.\n",
       "But you can see that we have a few different ones here.\n",
       "So Italian, Spanish, Korean, you have Thai, Thai QA squad here,\n",
       "and then also French as well at the bottom.\n",
       "So you have plenty of choice.\n",
       "Now, obviously, you kind of need to know what sort of data set you're looking for.\n",
       "I know I'm looking for a squad data set.\n",
       "So I've gone, I've looked for squad.\n",
       "There are other ones as well, actually.\n",
       "If I change this to lower, you'll see those also pop up.\n",
       "Okay, so we have like this one here and this one.\n",
       "This one doesn't seem to work.\n",
       "It's fine.\n",
       "Now, to load one of those data sets, obviously we're going to be using squad.\n",
       "We write data set equals data sets dot load data set.\n",
       "And then in here, we just write our data set name, so squad.\n",
       "Now, there's two ways to download your data.\n",
       "So if we do this, this is the default method.\n",
       "We are going to download and cache the whole data set in memory.\n",
       "Which for squad is fine.\n",
       "I think squad, it's not a huge data set, so it's not really a problem.\n",
       "But when you think, okay, if we wanted the English OSCA data set, that's massive.\n",
       "That's 1.2 terabytes.\n",
       "So in those cases, you probably don't want to download it all onto your machine.\n",
       "So what you can do instead is you set streaming equal to true.\n",
       "And when streaming is equal to true, you do need to make some changes to your code,\n",
       "which I'll show you.\n",
       "And there are also some things, particularly filtering, which we will cover later on,\n",
       "which we can't do with streaming.\n",
       "But we will just go ahead and for now we're going to use streaming.\n",
       "We'll switch over to not streaming later on.\n",
       "And this creates like a iteratable data set object.\n",
       "And it means that whenever we are calling a specific record within that data set,\n",
       "it is only going to download or store that single record or multiple records in our memory at once.\n",
       "So we're not downloading the data set.\n",
       "We're just processing it as we get, which is, I think, very important.\n",
       "And it is, I think, very useful.\n",
       "Now, you can see here we have two actual subsets within our data.\n",
       "If we want to select a specific subset, all we have to do is rewrite data sets again.\n",
       "So let me actually copy this.\n",
       "So we copy that.\n",
       "And if we just want a subset, we write split.\n",
       "And in this case, it would be train or validation.\n",
       "And if I just call execute that.\n",
       "So I'm not going to store that in our data set variable here,\n",
       "because I don't want to use just train.\n",
       "We have this single iterable data set object.\n",
       "So we're just pulling in this single part of it or single subset.\n",
       "And we can also view.\n",
       "So here we can see we have train and validation.\n",
       "If you want to see it in a more clear way, you can use dictionary syntax.\n",
       "So sorry, data set keys.\n",
       "You can use dictionary syntax for most of this.\n",
       "So we have train and validation.\n",
       "Now there's also, so the moment we have our data set,\n",
       "we don't really know anything about it.\n",
       "So we have this train subset.\n",
       "And let's say I want to understand what is in there.\n",
       "So what I can do to start is I write a data set train.\n",
       "And I can write, for example, the data set size.\n",
       "So how big is it?\n",
       "Right, data set size, data set, not data size, size.\n",
       "Don't know what I was doing there.\n",
       "Let me see that we get, so it's like, so 80, about 90, 90 megabytes.\n",
       "So reasonably big, but it's not anything huge, nothing crazy.\n",
       "We can also, so we have that.\n",
       "We can also get, if I copy this, you can also get a description.\n",
       "Let me see what the data set is.\n",
       "So SQUAD, I didn't even mention it already,\n",
       "but SQUAD is the Stanford Question Answering Data Set.\n",
       "So use it generally for training Q&A models or testing Q&A models.\n",
       "And you can pause and read that if you want to.\n",
       "And then another thing that is pretty important is\n",
       "what are the features that we have inside here?\n",
       "Now we can also just print out one of the samples,\n",
       "but it's useful to know, I think.\n",
       "And this also gives you data types, so it's kind of useful.\n",
       "So we have ID, title, context, question, and answers.\n",
       "All of them are strings.\n",
       "Answers is actually, so within answers we have, it says,\n",
       "Sequency, we can view it as a dictionary.\n",
       "But we have a text, a attribute, and also an answer star attribute.\n",
       "So that's pretty useful to know, I think.\n",
       "And to view one of our samples,\n",
       "so we have all the features here,\n",
       "but let's say we just want to see what it actually looks like.\n",
       "We can write data set and we go train.\n",
       "And when we have streaming set to false, we can write this.\n",
       "But because we have streaming set to true, we can't do this.\n",
       "So instead what we have to do is we\n",
       "actually just iterate through the data set.\n",
       "So we just go for sample in data set.\n",
       "And we just want to print a single sample.\n",
       "And then I don't want to print anymore,\n",
       "so I'm going to write break after that.\n",
       "So we just print one of those samples.\n",
       "And then we see, okay, we have the ID, we have title.\n",
       "So each of these samples is being pulled from a different Wikipedia,\n",
       "pulled from a different Wikipedia page.\n",
       "In this case, the title is a titled page.\n",
       "So this one is from the University of Notre Dame Wikipedia page.\n",
       "We have answers.\n",
       "So further down, we're going to ask a question and these answers here.\n",
       "So we have the text, which is the text answer.\n",
       "And then we have the position,\n",
       "so the character position where the answer starts within the context,\n",
       "which is what you can see here.\n",
       "Now we have a question here, which we're asking.\n",
       "And then the model, the Q&A model is going to\n",
       "extract the answer from our context there.\n",
       "Okay.\n",
       "So we're not going to be training model in this video or anything like that.\n",
       "We're just experimenting with the data sets library.\n",
       "We don't need to worry so much about that.\n",
       "So the first thing I want to do is have a look at how we can modify some of the features in our data.\n",
       "So with SQUAD, when we are training a model,\n",
       "one of the first things we would do is we take our answer start and the text\n",
       "and we will use that to get the answer end position as well.\n",
       "So let's go ahead and do that.\n",
       "So I first I want to just have a look, okay, for sample in the data set train,\n",
       "I'm just going to print out a few of the answer features.\n",
       "So we have sample answer or answers, sorry.\n",
       "And I just want to print that.\n",
       "So print it.\n",
       "And I want to say, okay, I want to enumerate this.\n",
       "So I can count how many times we're going through it.\n",
       "So here I'm just viewing the data so we can actually see what we have in there.\n",
       "So I want to say, if i is greater than four, just break, just stop printing answers for us.\n",
       "So and then we have a few of these.\n",
       "So we have text and we have answer start.\n",
       "We want to add answer end.\n",
       "And the way that we do that is pretty straightforward.\n",
       "We just need to take the answer start and we add the length of our text to that to get the answer end.\n",
       "Nothing, nothing complicated there.\n",
       "So what we're going to do here is modify the answers feature.\n",
       "And the best way or I think the least the most common way of modifying features\n",
       "or adding new features as well is to use the map method.\n",
       "So we go data set.\n",
       "So it's going to output a new data set.\n",
       "So we write data set train equals data set train.\n",
       "And we're going to use the map method.\n",
       "And with map we use lambda.\n",
       "So we write lambda x.\n",
       "So in here we're building a lambda function.\n",
       "And what we need to do.\n",
       "So this is one of the things that changes depending on whether you're using streaming or not.\n",
       "So with streaming equals true in here we need to specify every single feature.\n",
       "So what I mean by that is let me do it for streaming faults initially.\n",
       "So when streaming is false we would just write answers.\n",
       "And we would write the modification to that feature.\n",
       "So in this case we are taking the current answers.\n",
       "So it would be x answers.\n",
       "And we would be merging that with a new dictionary item which is going to be answers end.\n",
       "So answer start.\n",
       "So answer end is equal to.\n",
       "And here what we have to do is we go x answers.\n",
       "So this is a little bit messy now.\n",
       "But it's just how it is.\n",
       "So we're within answers and we want to take the answer start position.\n",
       "So answer start.\n",
       "And we want to add.\n",
       "Let me start a new line here.\n",
       "And we want to add the length of answers text.\n",
       "OK so all we're doing there is we're taking answer start and we're adding answer text.\n",
       "Or the length of answer text to that to get our answer end.\n",
       "Now this is all we would have to write if we were using streaming equals false.\n",
       "But we're not.\n",
       "With streaming equals true we need to add every other feature in there as well.\n",
       "I'm not sure why this is the case.\n",
       "But it is.\n",
       "So we need to just add those in as well.\n",
       "So all they are is a direct mapping from the old version to the new data set.\n",
       "So we don't need to really do anything there.\n",
       "We just need to add ID.\n",
       "We want to map that to ID and do that for the other features as well.\n",
       "So we have also have context.\n",
       "Which is exit context.\n",
       "We have answer already done of course.\n",
       "A question which is going to be exit question.\n",
       "So ID context question answers.\n",
       "Is there anything else I'm missing?\n",
       "ID oh title of course.\n",
       "Title just title.\n",
       "Yeah so also add title in there as well.\n",
       "Okay and with that we should be ready to go.\n",
       "So let's map that.\n",
       "And what we'll find is when we're using streaming keywords equals true.\n",
       "The actual process is or the transformation that we just built is lazily loaded.\n",
       "So we haven't actually just done anything there.\n",
       "All we've said is we've passed this instruction to transform the data set in this way.\n",
       "But it hasn't actually transformed anything yet.\n",
       "It only performs this transformation when we call the data set.\n",
       "So if we did this again.\n",
       "This would call the data set and it would force the code to run this instruction or this transformation.\n",
       "So let's run that.\n",
       "And you see we actually do get an error here.\n",
       "And why is that?\n",
       "So let me come down.\n",
       "We have so what am I doing?\n",
       "And start plus delete those answers.\n",
       "What's wrong with that?\n",
       "Ah okay so if we look up here.\n",
       "We have these items here that are within the list.\n",
       "So we actually need to access that first item.\n",
       "But that's good because we saw that when we first execute this code nothing happened.\n",
       "And it only actually came across that error when we called a data set.\n",
       "Because that's when this transformation is actually performed.\n",
       "And now what we have to do is because we've already added this instruction to our data set\n",
       "you know transformation or building process.\n",
       "We actually need to reinitialize our data set.\n",
       "So we will come back up here.\n",
       "So where are you here?\n",
       "So date no not that one this one.\n",
       "So we need to load that again to reinitialize the all of the instructions that we've added in there.\n",
       "And then we can go ahead rerun this.\n",
       "And now it should work hopefully let's see.\n",
       "There we go.\n",
       "So now if we have a look at this.\n",
       "And this is something I probably should have done but I completely forgot to.\n",
       "So I should have added this as maybe a list rather than just the number.\n",
       "But it's fine because you know if you come across and you need to do this.\n",
       "You may want to add that in.\n",
       "But we're not doing anything other than playing around with the data sets library.\n",
       "So it's not really a problem.\n",
       "But you can see that we have added answers and into there now which is what we wanted to do.\n",
       "And also importantly is if I let me copy this bring down here.\n",
       "We'll notice that we do still have all of our data sets.\n",
       "So if I go here.\n",
       "I don't really need to remove that's fine.\n",
       "I'll just break straight away.\n",
       "That's fine.\n",
       "So sample sorry here.\n",
       "So you see the whole thing.\n",
       "And we see that we still have the ID.\n",
       "We have the text.\n",
       "We have the context.\n",
       "We have everything in there.\n",
       "Now I'm just going to show you you know why this breaks.\n",
       "Or what happens if I remove these.\n",
       "Okay so let me rerun that and this as well.\n",
       "So yeah so this should look the same.\n",
       "Do we have yet that's fine.\n",
       "But then if I run this.\n",
       "So before this had all the all the features but now we only have the single feature that we specified in this formula.\n",
       "So the answers.\n",
       "So that's why you need to when shuffle is set to true.\n",
       "That's why you need to add every single feature in there.\n",
       "Otherwise it's just going to remove them when you perform the map operation.\n",
       "But that's only the case when shuffle is actually set to true.\n",
       "Shuffle? Why am I saying shuffle? Streaming is set to true.\n",
       "So let me bring this down here.\n",
       "And let me also copy our initial loading code.\n",
       "So here.\n",
       "Because we're going to need to reload our data set now anyway.\n",
       "Because we just removed all the features from it.\n",
       "Okay and what I'm going to do now is just set streaming to false.\n",
       "And I'm going to run this same code where we still don't have our ids or anything like that in there.\n",
       "And we'll see what happens.\n",
       "As well we'll also notice we'll get a loading bar here.\n",
       "And it's going to take a little bit of time to process this.\n",
       "Although actually with this it's probably going to be super fast.\n",
       "So probably ignore that.\n",
       "But it will you see okay it's taking a little bit of time.\n",
       "So now it's going through a whole data set.\n",
       "We haven't called the date set.\n",
       "But we have used this map function.\n",
       "When streaming is set to false the data set isn't lazily loaded.\n",
       "And so the operation is going to be a bit more complicated.\n",
       "So the operation the map operation is performed as soon as you call it.\n",
       "So it's a slightly different behavior.\n",
       "And the other behavior which is different is the fact that\n",
       "we only need to specify the answers feature here.\n",
       "So we only when we have streaming set to false.\n",
       "We don't need to include every feature within the map operation.\n",
       "We only need to include the feature that we are modifying or creating.\n",
       "Which you know it's weird I don't know why there's a behavior difference\n",
       "when streaming is true or false.\n",
       "But it is there.\n",
       "So if I now take this again.\n",
       "Come down here and run that.\n",
       "We see now that we have all of our features again.\n",
       "Right so before when streaming was true.\n",
       "If I run this code it would have only included our answers.\n",
       "The id, title, context, question they all would have been removed.\n",
       "But now with streaming equal to false they're still there.\n",
       "So weird a weird.\n",
       "So it's a weird feature or a weird behavior.\n",
       "But it's how it is and we obviously just need to deal with it.\n",
       "Now the next thing I want to show you is how we can also add batching\n",
       "to our mapping process.\n",
       "So typically with well pretty much every or any as far as I can think of any\n",
       "NLP tasks we're going to want to tokenize our text.\n",
       "So we're going to go ahead and do that for Q&A.\n",
       "So we would import transformers or from transformers import a BERT tokenizer.\n",
       "Let's say and I would initialize that.\n",
       "So this is you know what we typically do.\n",
       "We do tokenizer equals BERT tokenizer from pre-trained.\n",
       "And let's say BERT base un-gased.\n",
       "Okay I'll initialize that.\n",
       "And then what I want to do is I'm going to tokenize my context or question and context.\n",
       "In the format that SQUAD would usually expect when you're doing Q&A or building a Q&A model.\n",
       "And I want to do that using the map function.\n",
       "So you can do this in both streaming and non-streaming by the way.\n",
       "So we just write date set.\n",
       "It was train so same as before.\n",
       "Date set it was train or date set train dot map.\n",
       "We are using a lambda function so lambda x.\n",
       "And in here we just want to say tokenizer.\n",
       "So I'm not doing the usually when you write this you would include a dictionary here.\n",
       "But the tokenizer the output from the tokenizer is already in dictionary format.\n",
       "So we don't need to I don't need to do it in this case.\n",
       "But basically what we have here is is still a dictionary.\n",
       "And what I want to do is so with Q&A in your tokenizer you pass two text inputs.\n",
       "You pass your question and you would also pass your question.\n",
       "And you would also then pass your context.\n",
       "And as usual we would we set our max length.\n",
       "So usually 512.\n",
       "I would set padding equal to the max length.\n",
       "And also do truncation as well.\n",
       "Okay so very typical tokenization process.\n",
       "Nothing there's nothing different going on here.\n",
       "This is what we normally do when we tokenize our text going into a transform model.\n",
       "And then we want to say okay batched equals true.\n",
       "So this allows us to do everything or perform this operation in batches.\n",
       "And then we can also specify our batch size.\n",
       "So batch size equals let's say 32.\n",
       "So now when we run this where is it where is it going?\n",
       "It's here. Now when we run this the map function here is going to tokenize our question and context in batches of 32.\n",
       "So let's go ahead and do that.\n",
       "Okay and then you can you can see that processing there.\n",
       "So I mean that's that's all we really need to do with that.\n",
       "So I think that's probably it for the map method.\n",
       "And we'll well I'll fast forward and we'll continue with I think a few of the methods I think are quite useful as well.\n",
       "Okay so that's just finishing up now.\n",
       "So we can go ahead and have a look at what we've actually produced.\n",
       "So come to here and say dataset train.\n",
       "So what do we have now?\n",
       "We have answers like we did before but now we also have attention mask.\n",
       "We have input ids and we also have token type ids.\n",
       "Which are the three tensors that we usually output from the tokenizer when we do that.\n",
       "So we now have those in there as well.\n",
       "We can also have a look another thing as well we can now rather than looping through our dataset\n",
       "because we're not using a we're not using streaming which is true we're using streaming equals false.\n",
       "We can now do this and we can see okay we have attention mask and it's not going to show me everything because it's quite large.\n",
       "So I'll just delete that but you can see that we have the attention mask in there.\n",
       "So what I want to do is say I want to be quite pedantic and I don't like the fact that\n",
       "there is the fact that we have one feature called title.\n",
       "Maybe I want to say okay it should be topic because it's a topic of the context and the question.\n",
       "If I want to be really pedantic and modify that I could say dataset train rename column.\n",
       "And to be honest you can use it for this of course but you're probably not going to you're probably\n",
       "going to use it more for when you need to rename a column to make sure it aligns to whatever the\n",
       "expected inputs are for a transformer model for example.\n",
       "So that's where you would use it but I'm just using this example.\n",
       "So I'm going to rename the column title to topic and let's print out and dataset train again.\n",
       "So down here we have title and the moment we're going to have topic.\n",
       "Okay so now we have topic.\n",
       "So just rename column like I said come useful not in this case but generally this is usually useful.\n",
       "Now what I may want to do as well is remove certain records from this dataset.\n",
       "So so far we've been printing out the here we have this which is now topic.\n",
       "We have University of Notre Dame.\n",
       "Maybe for whatever reason we don't want to include those topics so we can say\n",
       "very similar to before we write dataset train equals dataset train again.\n",
       "This time I'm going to filter so we're going to filter out records that we don't want.\n",
       "And again it's very similar to the syntax we use for the map function which is the lambda.\n",
       "And in here we just need to specify the condition for the samples that we do want to include\n",
       "or we do want to keep.\n",
       "And in this case we want to say okay wherever the topic is not equal to University\n",
       "of Notre Dame.\n",
       "Okay so we'll run this and we'll have a look at what we produce.\n",
       "So dataset train so somehow like we have number of rows here which is just over 88,000.\n",
       "And we should get a lower number now.\n",
       "Now this will also go through so this remember we have shuffle.\n",
       "Set to shuffle what I keep calling it shuffle.\n",
       "We have streaming set to false this time.\n",
       "So it's going to run through the whole dataset and perform this filtering operation.\n",
       "Now whilst we're waiting for that.\n",
       "Now I'll just fast forward again to when this finishes in a moment.\n",
       "Okay so now we have this finished and we can now run this.\n",
       "It's finished and we have before we had 88,000 rows now we have 87.3.\n",
       "And we should see so let me take the dataset train\n",
       "topic and I want to see let's say the first five of those.\n",
       "Okay now they're all Beyonce rather than before where it was the University of Notre Dame.\n",
       "So we have those and what we may want to do now is say for example we're performing inference\n",
       "with Q&A with a transformer model.\n",
       "We don't really need all of the features that we have here.\n",
       "So we would only need the attention mask, the input ids and also the token type ids.\n",
       "So what we can do now is we can remove some of those columns.\n",
       "So we'll do dataset train as always dataset train again.\n",
       "And we want to remove those columns so remove columns.\n",
       "And we'll just remove so all of them other than the ones that we want.\n",
       "So do answers context id question and topic.\n",
       "Okay and then let's have a look at what we have left.\n",
       "Okay and then that's it so we have those final features and these are the ones that we would\n",
       "input into a transform model for training.\n",
       "Now I mean there's nothing else I really want to cover.\n",
       "I think that is pretty much all you need to know on Iconface datasets to get started\n",
       "and start building pretty I think good input pipelines and using some of the\n",
       "datasets that are available.\n",
       "So we'll leave it there.\n",
       "Thank you very much for watching and I will see you again in the next one.\n",

       "when we're using net sentence prediction\n",
       "we're training the BERT model\n",
       "to better comprehend\n",
       "the style of language that\n",
       "we train it on. So\n",
       "in here we have our\n",
       "paragraphs and they're all separated by a new\n",
       "line character. So I'm just going to add\n",
       "another little bit of code here\n",

       "split of sentences\n",
       "that are random and sentences\n",
       "that are not random.\n",
       "So we're going to be taking\n",

       "do that we first\n",
       "want a bag of sentences\n",
       "to actually pull that\n",
       "text from. So\n",
       "the reason we can't just use text\n",

       "we\n",

       "well as that we also need to add that condition\n",
       "that we don't want any sentences that\n",
       "look like this. So we just add\n",
       "that in so if sentence\n",
       "is not equal\n",
       "to that\n",
       "and\n",
       "that should be OK. So let's check\n",
       "length. OK so\n",
       "we get 1372\n",

       "So we\n",
       "now have the 1300\n",
       "sentences to sample\n",
       "from and now we want to do is\n",
       "loop through each sentence within\n",
       "text or each paragraph within text\n",
       "choose a sentence\n",
       "from each paragraph if\n",

       "multiple sentences only\n",
       "and\n",
       "then 50 percent of the time\n",
       "select a random sentence\n",
       "from a bag and append that to the end\n",
       "50 percent of the time\n",

       "So to\n",
       "create that random\n",
       "50 percent we import\n",
       "the random library and\n",
       "we also want to\n",
       "initialize our sentence\n",
       "a list sentence\n",
       "b list.\n",
       "And we\n",
       "also need to initialize a\n",
       "label list. OK so\n",
       "that'll be 0 or 1.\n",
       "Now what we want to do\n",
       "is loop through each paragraph in our\n",
       "text so for paragraph\n",
       "in text\n",
       "and then here\n",

       "I don't want to get\n",

       "So the reason I'm doing that is for example this\n",

       "the selection.\n",
       "Now what we want to do is\n",

       "So our\n",

       "we want to make sure\n",
       "that we have enough space\n",
       "at the end of our sentences.\n",
       "So here\n",
       "to take both sentence A and\n",
       "sentence B. So let's say\n",
       "for example we have\n",
       "I'm going to use an example here so we have\n",

       "if we select 4\n",
       "then we don't\n",
       "have a sentence B to select from.\n",
       "So what we are going to do here\n",
       "is say you choose a\n",
       "random integer between 0\n",
       "and we want 3 to be the maximum\n",
       "there.\n",
       "So how do we do that?\n",
       "We've got the number of\n",
       "sentences here so this value will be 5\n",
       "in this case so\n",
       "we would say number of sentences\n",
       "is 5 minus\n",
       "2 because we don't\n",
       "the maximum value\n",
       "we want to select is 3 in this case.\n",
       "So it's going to be the number\n",

       "minus 2.\n",
       "Ok.\n",
       "Now\n",
       "what we do is we do our 50-50\n",
       "randomize or not randomize\n",
       "sentence B.\n",
       "So if random.\n",
       "random so this will just\n",

       "If that\n",

       "Ok. So for the random\n",

       "what we do is sentence B\n",
       ".append\n",
       "and then here we would\n",
       "append a random sentence\n",
       "from our bag up here.\n",
       "So to\n",
       "do that we would just write bag\n",
       "and then in here we need to\n",
       "select a random integer\n",
       "like we did up here. Ok. So\n",
       "we're going to use that same\n",
       "function. So random.\n",
       "randint\n",
       "and that needs to be between 0\n",
       "and the length of\n",
       "our bag minus 1.\n",
       "So we use bag\n",
       "size that's why we\n",
       "have it.\n",
       "So bag size minus 1.\n",
       "Ok. Now we'll select a random\n",
       "sentence B from that bag for\n",
       "us. And\n",
       "as well as that we\n",
       "also want to set a label.\n",
       "So our label in this case\n",
       "would be\n",
       "a 1. So\n",
       "we have the 0 which means it is the next sentence.\n",
       "We have a 1 which means it is\n",
       "not the next sentence. So we\n",
       "set 1.\n",
       "Now our sentence A\n",
       "it our sentence A gets selected.\n",
       "It's the same thing no\n",
       "matter whether we have\n",
       "the random sentence\n",
       "B or the not random sentence B.\n",
       "So we can actually write\n",
       "our sentence A append\n",
       "up here.\n",
       "And this is just\n",
       "going to be sentences.\n",
       "And in the\n",
       "index we have start which is\n",
       "our value from here.\n",
       "Ok. So we\n",
       "have the random option.\n",
       "Now let's\n",
       "do our not random option.\n",
       "So in here we\n",
       "write sentence B append.\n",
       "And\n",
       "this needs to append sentences\n",
       "start plus\n",
       "1. So the following sentence\n",
       "after our sentence A.\n",
       "And our label here\n",
       "would be 0\n",
       "which means it is the next sentence.\n",
       "So let's\n",
       "there's quite a lot of code. Let's run\n",
       "that and see what we get.\n",
       "Ok.\n",
       "Now\n",
       "what I want to do\n",
       "is let's have a look\n",
       "at the first\n",
       "few labels. See if we have a\n",
       "mix of different ones in there.\n",
       "Ok. We just have 1, 1, 1. So I'm going to\n",
       "rerun this because I want to show you the\n",
       "difference between 0's and 1's here.\n",
       "Ok. So we\n",
       "have these. So let me\n",
       "print out\n",
       "what we have.\n",
       "So\n",
       "for i in\n",
       "range 3. So I'm just\n",
       "doing this so we can print and see what\n",
       "we actually have in our training data.\n",
       "So I want to\n",
       "print the\n",
       "label at that\n",
       "index. And then\n",
       "I want to print the\n",
       "sentence A.\n",
       "At that\n",
       "index. And we'll follow that\n",
       "with\n",
       "a new line character\n",
       "and a few dashes so we can\n",
       "distinguish between the start and end of\n",
       "sentence A and B. And then we will\n",
       "do print sentence\n",
       "B.\n",
       "And then I'm just going to add in a new line there\n",
       "to distinguish it from the next set of\n",
       "answers.\n",
       "So\n",
       "see here that we have\n",
       "0. We have\n",
       "our sentence A.\n",
       "And our sentence\n",
       "B is a continuation\n",
       "of that first sentence.\n",
       "Because we have that label\n",
       "0. We know that.\n",
       "So we have sentence A\n",
       "here. And again\n",
       "this one here is a continuation\n",
       "of this sentence\n",
       "A. And then down\n",
       "here we have a 1. So this is where we've\n",
       "selected a random sentence\n",
       "B.\n",
       "And if we\n",
       "read this. I know it's not the easiest\n",
       "thing to read.\n",
       "Yeah the difference. There's\n",
       "reasonably clear\n",
       "difference in the context there.\n",
       "Okay. Now\n",
       "this won't always work. In some\n",
       "cases we might select even\n",
       "the same sentence for sentence A and B.\n",
       "But for what\n",
       "we're doing here I think this is a completely\n",
       "reasonable\n",
       "way of\n",
       "going about it. Because we don't want to\n",
       "over complicate things. If we wanted\n",
       "to really be very strict\n",
       "on it we could add in some extra\n",
       "logic which confirms that we\n",
       "are not getting a\n",
       "sentence B from around the same area as\n",
       "sentence A for example. But for\n",
       "now this is I think fine.\n",
       "Okay.\n",
       "So we've now prepared our\n",
       "data. What we need to do now\n",
       "is tokenize it. So\n",
       "to tokenize our\n",
       "data we're just going to use a\n",
       "tokenizer which we've already\n",
       "initialized. And in here\n",
       "we can actually just pass our sentence\n",
       "A and sentence B\n",
       "like this. And our tokenizer\n",
       "will deal with how to fit both of those together\n",
       "for us. So that's\n",
       "pretty useful. We're going to\n",
       "be using PyTorch. So we want to return\n",
       "tensors Pt.\n",
       "And as\n",
       "well as that we need to\n",
       "truncate or pad each\n",
       "one of those sequences to\n",
       "a maximum length\n",
       "of\n",
       "512.\n",
       "And we truncate\n",
       "using this.\n",
       "And we also set\n",
       "padding equal to max\n",
       "length.\n",
       "Okay. So\n",
       "that should be\n",
       "okay. Let's have a look at what we\n",
       "have. We see that we have input\n",
       "IDs, token type IDs and attention\n",
       "mass. Let's have a look at\n",
       "what they look like. So you see\n",
       "here we have all these different\n",
       "vectors and that is a single\n",
       "pair of sentence A\n",
       "and sentence B.\n",
       "And we have quite a few\n",
       "of those.\n",
       "Now our token\n",
       "type IDs\n",
       "what we would expect is sentence\n",
       "A would have a token type\n",
       "ID of 0 and\n",
       "sentence B would have token\n",
       "type ID of 1.\n",
       "We don't see those ones in there.\n",
       "So let's expand\n",
       "that out a little bit.\n",
       "So we'll go with\n",
       "token type\n",
       "IDs.\n",
       "Let's go with number 0.\n",
       "Okay. So now\n",
       "we see okay the reason is because\n",
       "they're in the middle here.\n",
       "So what we're seeing here is sentence A\n",
       "followed by sentence\n",
       "B. And then\n",
       "these remaining 0 tokens\n",
       "are our padding tokens.\n",
       "So we can also see that if we switch\n",
       "across to input IDs\n",
       "we see that we have\n",
       "all these padding tokens.\n",
       "And as well another item\n",
       "that the tokenizer\n",
       "does for us automatically is\n",
       "adds a separator token in the middle\n",
       "of our sentence A and B. So\n",
       "sentence A is this, sentence B\n",
       "is this.\n",
       "Okay.\n",
       "So\n",
       "we have our\n",
       "input tensors. We also need to\n",
       "build our labels tensor.\n",
       "And to do that\n",
       "we just we add it to this\n",
       "inputs variable.\n",
       "So we have inputs labels.\n",
       "And we set\n",
       "that equal to torch\n",
       "long tensor.\n",
       "And\n",
       "this is a little bit\n",
       "different. So let me\n",
       "just expand that out.\n",
       "So let's say we just add labels\n",
       "in here.\n",
       "So sorry\n",
       "label.\n",
       "And we just get this one big tensor\n",
       "which is not really in the\n",
       "correct format that we need.\n",
       "We need each one of these\n",
       "to\n",
       "match to our\n",
       "input IDs, token type\n",
       "IDs and attention mask. So\n",
       "what I mean by that is\n",
       "if we just\n",
       "have a look at this input IDs\n",
       "you see that we get\n",
       "it's like a list within a list.\n",
       "We need that but for our\n",
       "labels as well. They're in a different format\n",
       "at the moment as you can see.\n",
       "So we could try\n",
       "transposing that.\n",
       "But you see that doesn't actually do anything\n",
       "because it's just a single\n",
       "invention. So it's just switching everything\n",
       "around.\n",
       "So let's remove that transpose\n",
       "and let's add a list inside here.\n",
       "You see now\n",
       "we're getting somewhere\n",
       "not quite there yet. So now we have\n",
       "a list within a list.\n",
       "And now what we do\n",
       "is we transpose it and now\n",
       "we get what we need. So we have this\n",
       "almost vector of\n",
       "each of these and each one of these here.\n",
       "So this vector\n",
       "matches up to this\n",
       "value here.\n",
       "And this one\n",
       "matches up to this one. And that's\n",
       "what we want. So let's copy\n",
       "that and put it here.\n",
       "So now\n",
       "we have all the sensors\n",
       "we need for training our model. And\n",
       "what we now need to do is set up the input\n",
       "pipeline for training.\n",
       "So when we're training we're\n",
       "going to need to use a PyTorch\n",
       "data loader object.\n",
       "And to create that data loader\n",
       "object we need to create\n",
       "a PyTorch data set object\n",
       "from our data.\n",
       "So to do that we\n",
       "write this. So we're going to be using\n",
       "a data set\n",
       "class here. So I'm going to call it\n",
       "MeditationsDataSet.\n",
       "And in here we write torch\n",
       "utils data\n",
       "data set. So that\n",
       "makes sure that we are\n",
       "using the correct format for the\n",
       "class for a data set.\n",
       "Now we need to define a few\n",
       "methods inside here.\n",
       "So our initialization method\n",
       "and for our initialization\n",
       "method we need to be able to pass our\n",
       "data. So we'll pass\n",
       "it through this encodings variable.\n",
       "And all we need to\n",
       "do in here is assign our encodings\n",
       "variable to be an internal attribute\n",
       "of that data set or that\n",
       "class. So write self\n",
       "encodings\n",
       "equals encodings.\n",
       "So that allows us to\n",
       "create our data set class.\n",
       "And then our\n",
       "data loader needs two\n",
       "different methods from this class as well.\n",
       "It needs a get item method\n",
       "and a\n",
       "length method. So let's do\n",
       "the length method first. It's easier.\n",
       "So our length\n",
       "we don't need to pass anything to this.\n",
       "It's just the same\n",
       "as when you would write\n",
       "this and you put something\n",
       "inside it. So list\n",
       "0 1. We get that length.\n",
       "That's exactly what we're doing here.\n",
       "So this creates a\n",
       "enables you to do this same\n",
       "method on your class.\n",
       "And\n",
       "inside here all we need to do is\n",
       "return the length. So what\n",
       "length should we return? Well\n",
       "if we just do length\n",
       "of inputs\n",
       "we get 4 because we only\n",
       "have 4 items in there.\n",
       "So we don't want that.\n",
       "We actually want the number of samples\n",
       "that we have within\n",
       "our inputs. So what\n",
       "we can do instead is we write inputs\n",
       "input ids\n",
       "shape 0.\n",
       "So we have these\n",
       "317 items.\n",
       "So just show\n",
       "you here. See this is\n",
       "our encoding\n",
       "size. So the\n",
       "max length we set here.\n",
       "And this is the number of\n",
       "sentences or sentence pairs\n",
       "that we have.\n",
       "So\n",
       "we take that\n",
       "and we return it. But obviously we\n",
       "don't have inputs. We now have this\n",
       "self encodings. So\n",
       "swap it like\n",
       "that. And then\n",
       "we want to\n",
       "pass this get item\n",
       "method. And what\n",
       "this does is given a certain\n",
       "index it will return\n",
       "your 4 dictionaries\n",
       "your input ids, token type ids\n",

       "dictionary which we've created down here\n",

       "So we need to\n",
       "allow it to take an index\n",
       "argument there.\n",
       "What we do\n",
       "is return\n",
       "let me\n",
       "show you down here what that would look like.\n",
       "So we want\n",
       "to create a dictionary just like\n",
       "we have up here but we just want that for that\n",
       "specific index.\n",
       "So what we write\n",
       "is key.\n",
       "And then we write our value\n",
       "index. So\n",
       "maybe it makes more\n",
       "sense for me to write so tensor.\n",
       "So our key is our\n",
       "input ids, attention mask\n",
       "and so on. Our tensor is obviously the tensor\n",
       "inside there but we have the full tensor\n",
       "containing all 317\n",
       "items.\n",
       "So then we pull out the\n",
       "index for\n",
       "that tensor. But we need to make sure we're\n",
       "doing that for each of our\n",
       "items. So\n",
       "because we have multiple tensors\n",
       "here don't we? We have the 4\n",
       "input ids, labels and so on.\n",
       "So\n",
       "we do for\n",
       "key\n",
       "and tensor in\n",
       "and in here we would write\n",
       "let's say we do\n",
       "inputs items.\n",
       "So\n",
       "let me just\n",
       "take that out so you can see.\n",
       "So that gives us our dictionary items.\n",
       "And if we\n",
       "do a for loop so\n",
       "for key\n",
       "tensor in\n",
       "we want to\n",
       "print\n",
       "the key.\n",
       "So you see that we're looping\n",
       "through each one of those.\n",
       "And we also get the tensor out for each\n",
       "one of those as well.\n",
       "But we're specifying a\n",
       "certain tensor\n",
       "with each one. So let's say\n",
       "we want 0 here.\n",
       "We get the\n",
       "0 tensor and nothing\n",
       "more.\n",
       "But we want to\n",
       "specify an index so we copy\n",
       "that.\n",
       "And it's what we're going to return here.\n",
       "Except here\n",
       "we change it to self\n",
       "encodings.\n",
       "So that's our class.\n",
       "And\n",
       "with that we can\n",
       "initialize our data set object.\n",
       "So data set equals\n",
       "meditations data set.\n",
       "And then all we need to do\n",
       "is pass our\n",
       "data which is\n",
       "just inputs here.\n",
       "Like that.\n",
       "OK. So that's our data\n",
       "set ready. Now we can initialize\n",
       "our data loader.\n",
       "And we do that\n",
       "like this. So we\n",
       "do loader\n",
       "torch\n",
       "utils\n",
       "data dot data loader.\n",
       "We pass our data set object.\n",
       "We also want\n",
       "to specify the batch size.\n",
       "So I'm going to use batches of\n",
       "16.\n",
       "And then we also want\n",
       "to shuffle our data set\n",
       "as well. So we write shuffle\n",
       "equals\n",
       "true.\n",
       "And that's our data\n",
       "loader. So\n",
       "now\n",
       "now we just need to set\n",
       "up a few model\n",
       "training parameters. So\n",
       "the first thing we want to do\n",
       "is move our model\n",
       "to a GPU if we have\n",
       "a GPU. So\n",
       "to figure that out\n",
       "what we do is write\n",
       "let me do this\n",
       "torch\n",
       "device CUDA.\n",
       "So this is we say\n",
       "we want to use a CUDA enabled GPU\n",
       "if torch\n",
       "dot CUDA\n",
       "is available.\n",
       "So this will check our\n",
       "environment and check if we have\n",
       "a CUDA enabled GPU.\n",
       "If it isn't available\n",
       "we want to use a\n",
       "torch device\n",
       "CPU.\n",
       "So run that and see\n",
       "for me I have a CUDA enabled GPU\n",
       "so it comes up with this.\n",
       "So we saw that in\n",
       "device. And then\n",
       "what we can do is move\n",
       "our model and also move our tensors\n",
       "later on to that\n",
       "device for training.\n",
       "So we just write model\n",
       "to device.\n",
       "And we'll get\n",
       "a lot of output from that.\n",
       "Just ignore that we don't need to worry about\n",
       "it.\n",
       "And we can also\n",
       "activate our models training mode\n",
       "like that.\n",
       "OK. So\n",
       "we've moved our model over to\n",
       "GPU activate training mode.\n",
       "Now what we need to do\n",
       "is initialize our optimizer.\n",
       "So we're going to be using\n",
       "Adam with weighted decay for our\n",
       "optimizer. So\n",
       "to use that we need to import\n",
       "it from transformers.\n",
       "So from transformers\n",
       "import\n",
       "AdamW.\n",
       "And we\n",
       "initialize the\n",
       "optimizer like\n",
       "this. So we\n",
       "AdamW we pass our model\n",
       "parameters. And we\n",
       "also want to pass the learning rate\n",
       "which is going to be\n",
       "5e to the minus 5.\n",
       "5e to the minus\n",
       "5. OK that's a\n",
       "pretty common one for training transformers.\n",
       "And\n",
       "that\n",
       "looks pretty good to me.\n",
       "So now we can begin\n",
       "our training loop. So\n",
       "first I want to\n",
       "import something called TQDM.\n",
       "Now this is purely\n",
       "for aesthetics. We don't need it\n",
       "for training. This is so\n",
       "that we see a little progress bar during\n",
       "training otherwise we don't see anything.\n",
       "So I just want to include\n",
       "that so we can actually see what is going on.\n",
       "So from TQDM\n",
       "import TQDM. So this is optional\n",
       "we don't need to include it. It's up to you.\n",
       "But I would recommend it.\n",
       "We'll train\n",
       "for\n",
       "let's go with 2\n",
       "epochs.\n",
       "Again we don't want to train transformers\n",
       "too much because they will easily\n",
       "over fit. And to be honest they'll probably\n",
       "over fit on this dataset because it's very\n",
       "small.\n",
       "But that's fine. We just want\n",
       "to use this as an example.\n",
       "So we're going\n",
       "to train for 2 epochs.\n",
       "And because we're using TQDM\n",
       "we want to set up our\n",
       "training loop like this. So we wrap\n",
       "it within a TQDM\n",
       "instance.\n",
       "And all we do here is pass our\n",
       "data loader. So we\n",
       "create that up here.\n",
       "That's our PyTorch data loader.\n",
       "And we also\n",
       "want to write leave\n",
       "equals true.\n",
       "So this is so that we can see\n",
       "the\n",
       "progress bar.\n",
       "And then we\n",
       "loop through each batch\n",
       "that will be generated\n",
       "by that loop generator.\n",
       "So for batch in loop.\n",
       "So now we're in our training loop.\n",
       "What we want to do here.\n",
       "Very first thing\n",
       "is set our\n",
       "optimizer's gradients to 0.\n",
       "So obviously in the\n",
       "very first\n",
       "loop that it's fine.\n",
       "It doesn't matter. But every loop after\n",
       "that our optimizer\n",
       "will have a set of gradients that have been\n",
       "calculated from the previous loop. And we need to\n",
       "reset those.\n",
       "So we write optim\n",
       "0grad\n",
       "and\n",
       "after that\n",
       "we can load\n",
       "in our\n",
       "batches or our tensors from\n",
       "our\n",
       "batch here.\n",
       "So we want input\n",
       "IDs equals\n",
       "a batch.\n",
       "And we access it like a dictionary.\n",
       "So we have input IDs.\n",
       "So input IDs.\n",
       "And\n",
       "one other thing that we need to do is our model\n",
       "is on our GPU. So we need to move\n",
       "the data that\n",
       "we're training on to our GPU\n",
       "as well.\n",
       "So we just write that.\n",
       "OK.\n",
       "And copy\n",
       "this. So we have\n",
       "one more.\n",
       "So we have all\n",
       "these that we create\n",
       "up here. So input ID, setting type ID\n",
       "attention mask and labels. We want\n",
       "all of those.\n",
       "So token type IDs\n",
       "attention\n",
       "mask\n",
       "and\n",
       "labels.\n",
       "OK. So\n",
       "initialize our gradients.\n",
       "We have\n",
       "pulled in\n",
       "our tensors and now we can\n",
       "process them\n",
       "through our model. So we do model\n",
       "input IDs.\n",
       "We have token type\n",
       "IDs.\n",
       "We also have the\n",
       "attention mask.\n",
       "And we\n",
       "also have our labels.\n",
       "OK.\n",
       "So that\n",
       "will create\n",
       "two tensors for us in the outputs.\n",
       "It will create a logits\n",
       "tensor which is our prediction.\n",
       "And it will create a\n",
       "loss tensor which is the\n",
       "difference between\n",
       "our prediction and our labels.\n",
       "So let's extract that\n",
       "loss. So we do outputs.loss.\n",
       "And then we also\n",
       "after extracting that loss we need to calculate\n",
       "that this is the overall loss. We need\n",
       "to calculate the loss for every parameter within\n",
       "our model so we can optimize on that.\n",
       "So we just write loss\n",
       "backward.\n",
       "Yeah backward.\n",
       "And then\n",
       "we do optim step.\n",
       "And this will\n",
       "use our optimizer\n",
       "and take a step to\n",
       "optimize based on the loss\n",
       "calculated here.\n",
       "And that is all we actually need\n",
       "for our training loop.\n",
       "We do also have the TQDM up here\n",
       "as well. So I just want to\n",
       "use that.\n",
       "And what we're going to do is we're just going to set\n",
       "the description of our loop\n",
       "at this current step\n",
       "equal to the epoch.\n",
       "So this is just\n",
       "purely aesthetics. We don't\n",
       "need this for training but it's just so we can\n",
       "see what is going on.\n",
       "And we also want to loop set\n",
       "postfix. And here I'm going to\n",
       "add in\n",
       "our loss which\n",
       "is just going to be\n",
       "loss equals loss.item\n",
       "like that.\n",
       "Now that should be okay.\n",
       "Let's give it a go.\n",
       "See what happens.\n",
       "Okay.\n",
       "So\n",
       "that looks pretty good.\n",
       "So you can see that our model is training. Loss\n",
       "is reducing.\n",
       "Now there isn't that much training data\n",
       "so we're not going to see anything crazy here\n",
       "but we can see that\n",
       "it is moving in the right direction. So that's pretty good.\n",
       "So that's\n",
       "everything for this video.\n",
       "It's a pretty long video.\n",
       "Recorded for 41 minutes.\n",
       "It'll probably be a little bit short for you.\n",
       "But yeah that's long.\n",
       "So\n",
       "that's everything for this video.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explored the application of `langchain-iris` to perform Natural Language Processing (NLP) queries on a YouTube audio transcription dataset. The key steps involved data loading, preprocessing, connecting to the vector database, and send prompts to find similar matched stored in the IRIS database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vectorized documents were stored in the IRIS database, allowing similarity searches based on user queries. Two sample queries were performed to demonstrate the capabilities: \"How to implement a chatbot?\" and \"How to detect hate speech?\". For both tests we got the expected results, i.e, the video title \"How to Build Custom Q&A Transformer Models in Python\" in the first test, and the title \"How-to do Sentiment Analysis with Flair in Python\" in the second test, over the six videos titles in the dataset. Similar matches also are retrieved for other videos, as its transcription also are similar to the topics searched, but with scores that means less similarity with the prompts tested, as expected as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook also showcased the option to display top-matching YouTube videos based on the queries provides a practical and engaging way to explore and understand the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can further customize and extend this notebook for their specific use cases, incorporating additional queries, dataset manipulations, or exploring different embeddings offered by LangChain."
