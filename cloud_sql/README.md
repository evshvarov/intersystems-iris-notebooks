# Machine Learning Projects Using InterSystems IntegratedML: A Guide for Hackathon Participants

Dear Students,

As we gear up for the upcoming hackathon, I'd like to introduce you to three machine learning projects that I've developed and hosted on GitHub. These projects leverage the power of InterSystems IntegratedML, serving as fantastic examples of how you can incorporate ML into your apps. Let's delve into them:

## 1. **NY Taxi Tip Prediction (Regression)**

**Description:**  
This project aims to predict the tip amount a New York taxi driver can expect from a ride based on various factors such as distance traveled, time of day, location, etc.

**IntegratedML Usage:**  
Using regression analysis through IntegratedML, the model is trained to understand and predict continuous tip values. Simple SQL commands are employed to preprocess the data, create the model, and make predictions, demonstrating the ease of use of InterSystemsâ€™ platform.

**Hackathon Potential:**  
For participants interested in data analysis, urban mobility, or economics, this project can serve as a blueprint. Think about adapting it for other cities or services, or integrating it with a broader application that aids taxi drivers in maximizing their earnings.

## 2. **Patient Readmission (Classification)**

**Description:**  
This project tackles the challenge of predicting whether a patient will be readmitted to the hospital after a given treatment or procedure.

**IntegratedML Usage:**  
Utilizing classification algorithms, the model categorizes patients into two classes: "Likely to be readmitted" and "Not likely to be readmitted". With IntegratedML's transparent modeling, you can easily understand the factors that play a role in readmission risks.

**Hackathon Potential:**  
Healthtech is a booming domain. Building on this project, you could devise a complete patient monitoring system, integrate with electronic health records, or even create a patient-centered app that provides personalized care tips to reduce readmission risks.

## 3. **Star Classification (Classification - Multi Classes)**

**Description:**  
A fascinating exploration into the cosmos, this project classifies stars into different categories based on their spectral characteristics, luminosity, temperature, and other properties.

**IntegratedML Usage:**  
The multi-class classification capability of IntegratedML is showcased here, where stars are categorized into various distinct classes. This demonstrates how one can deal with more complex categorization tasks effortlessly.

**Hackathon Potential:**  
For those with an interest in space and astrophysics, this project is a gem. Consider integrating it with augmented reality apps for stargazing, developing educational tools for students, or even collaborating with space agencies or observatories.

In conclusion, these projects are not only demonstrations of what's possible with IntegratedML but also starting points for your own innovative solutions. Think big, use these projects as a foundation, and let your creativity shine during the hackathon. Best of luck!
